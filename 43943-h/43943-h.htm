<h2>PREFACE TO SEVENTH EDITION.</h2>



<p><span class="dropcap">D</span>ietetic Reform is now being considered seriously
by thoughtful people in all parts of the world
<span class="figleft" style="width: 97px;">
<img src="images/illus_007.png" width="97" height="200" alt="" />
</span>
and interest in this important though
long neglected subject is increasing
every day.</p>

<p>The fact that our physical, mental,
and spiritual conditions are greatly influenced
by the nature and quality of our
daily food, and that, consequently, our
welfare depends upon a wise selection
of the same, is becoming generally
recognized.</p>

<p>Popular illusions concerning the
value of flesh-food have been much dispelled during
recent years by revelations concerning the physical
deterioration of the flesh-consuming nations, and
the comparative immunity from disease of people
who live on purer and more natural food; also
by a succession of remarkable victories won by
fruitarians who have secured numerous athletic
Championships and long distance Records.</p>

<p>Demonstration has been provided by the Japanese,
that a non-carnivorous and hygienic Race can
out-march and out-fight the numerically superior
forces of a colossal Empire; and that its national
and social life can be characterized by conspicuous
efficiency, sobriety, health, and vitality.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span></p>
<p>A vast amount of emphatic personal and medical
testimony to the advantages of the more simple
and natural <i>fruitarian</i> system of living is being
given by thousands of witnesses who speak from
experience; and such evidence is preparing the way
for a complete change of popular thought and
custom concerning dietetics.</p>

<p>In addition to such influences, an ever-increasing
consciousness that the emancipation of the animal
world from systematic massacre and ruthless cruelty
awaits the abandonment of the carnivorous habit
by the Western races of mankind, is exercising
a powerful effect upon the lives of multitudes of
men and women. In consequence of having reached
a comparatively advanced stage of evolution, they
realise the solidarity of sentient life and feel
humanely disposed towards all fellow-creatures;
and they cannot avoid the conviction that Man
was never intended to play the part of a remorseless
and bloodthirsty oppressor of the sub-human races.</p>

<p>Those who are labouring to bring about the
adoption of dietetic customs that neither violate
the physical laws of our being, nor outrage the
humane sentiments of the higher part of our nature,
are consequently now met by serious requests for
information concerning some way of escape from
bondage to ancestral barbaric custom, and the
safest path to a more rational and harmonious
existence. "How may we live out our full length
of days in health and vigour, instead of dying of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
disease?" "How may we avoid the painful
maladies that are prevalent, and escape the surgeon's
knife?" "How may we be delivered from further
participation in all this needless shedding of innocent
blood?" "How may we in a scientific way feed
ourselves with simple and hygienic food&mdash;with the
kindly fruits of the earth instead of the flesh of
murdered creatures who love life just as we do?"
Such questions as these are being asked by thousands
of earnest souls, and it is to help such
enquirers that this Guide-Book is published.</p>

<p>My aim has been to give practical, reliable and
up-to-date information in a concise form, avoiding
superfluous matter and 'faddism,' and only supplying
simple recipes which do not require the skill of a
'chef' for their interpretation. By spending a few
hours in thoughtful study of the following pages,
and by practising this reformed system of diet and
cookery in domestic life for a few weeks, any
intelligent person can master the chief principles
of fruitarian dietetics, and become qualified to
prepare appetising dishes suited to the taste of
a hermit or a <i>bon vivant</i> (provided that its possessor
be not hopelessly enamoured of the "flesh-pots of
Egypt" and the flavour of cooked blood).</p>

<p>A system of living that is earnestly recommended
by thousands of disinterested advocates who have
personally tried it, that comes to us full of promise
both for ourselves and others, that bids fair to
humanize and transform mankind and to solve many
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
of the world's social problems, and that is now
endorsed by so many progressive medical authorities,
merits such attention, and is worthy of trial.</p>

<p>As I am writing a <i>Guide</i> to reformed diet for
domestic use&mdash;not an elaborate treatise to justify
it&mdash;I have refrained from introducing medical and
experimental testimony concerning the dangerous
and injurious nature of flesh-food, and the advantages
of living upon the fruits of the earth, supplemented
by dairy products. Numerous standard works
are now obtainable which demonstrate that
the principles and arguments upon which the
Food-Reform Movement is based are supported
by an array of scientific evidence which is more
than sufficient to convince any unprejudiced, logical
and well-balanced mind. For such information
I must refer my readers to other publications,
and I have printed a short list of useful works on the
final pages of this book, for the benefit of those who
are as yet unacquainted with such literature.</p>

<p>For some of the recipes contained in the following
pages I am indebted to certain of the Members
of The Order of the Golden Age, and to other workers
in the Food-Reform Cause&mdash;but especially to Mrs.
Walter Carey, who has devoted much time to the task
of preparing and testing them. Most of them are
original, being the result of thoughtful experiment;
and they should, <i>if carefully followed</i>, result in the
production of dishes which will give satisfaction.
But if certain recipes do not commend themselves to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
some of my readers, they are invited to remember
that human palates differ considerably, and to try
other dishes with the hope that they will like them
better.</p>

<p>With the earnest desire that all who read this
book will make some sincere endeavour to seek
emancipation from the barbaric habits that are
prevalent in Western lands, and to cease from that
physical transgression in the matter of diet into which
our forefathers, at some period of the world's history,
appear to have fallen with such disastrous consequences
to themselves and their posterity, it is sent
forth upon its humble but beneficent mission. And
I trust that many, when they have proved that such a
way of living is both possible and advantageous, will
strive to persuade others to live as Children of God,
rather than as the beasts of prey.</p>

<p>Those who have reached that spiritual plane
where the sacredness of all sentient life becomes
recognised, and who find it painful to contemplate
the wanton and cruel slaughter which at present
takes place throughout Christendom&mdash;involving the
death of at least a million large animals every day&mdash;must
instinctively experience a longing to apprehend
some way by which this butchery can be brought to an
end. Such will be able to perceive the real significance
of, and necessity for, the twentieth-century crusade
against human carnivoracity&mdash;the Moloch idol of
these modern days. They will also feel individually
constrained to co-operate in the great work of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
bringing about this practical and beneficent Reformation,
and of giving to mankind the blessings that
will result from it.</p>

<p>As in the case of all previous editions of this book,
any financial profit derived from its sale will be
devoted to the exaltation of these humane and philanthropic
ideals&mdash;hence its presentation to The Order
of the Golden Age. My readers, therefore, who feel
that its circulation will tend to lessen the sum total of
human and sub-human suffering, are invited to assist
in securing for it a large circulation, by lending or
presenting copies to their friends, and making it
widely known. And to attain this end, the sympathetic
aid of journalists and other leaders of public
thought will be especially appreciated.</p>

<h2>THE TRUE IDEAL IN DIET.</h2>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>he physical structure of Man is declared by our most
eminent biologists and anatomists to be that of
<span class="figleft" style="width: 179px;">
<img src="images/illus_013.png" width="179" height="250" alt="Man is by Nature Fruitarian&mdash;not Carnivorous!!" />
</span>a <i>frugivorous</i> (fruit-eating) animal.
It is, therefore, our Creator's intention
that we should subsist upon
the various fruits of the earth&mdash;not
upon the products of the shambles.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a></p>



<p>The accepted scientific classification
places Man with the anthropoid
apes, at the head of the highest order of
mammals. These animals bear the closest
resemblance to human beings, their teeth
and internal organs being practically identical,
and in a natural state they subsist upon nuts,
seeds, grains, and other fruits. Hence those who
have studied this subject thoroughly can hardly entertain
any doubt that the more largely our diet consists
of these simple products of nature, the more likely
we shall be to enjoy health and to secure longevity.</p>

<p>The number and variety of such fruits and seeds
is very great (including all the nuts and cereals <i>and
their products</i>, as well as the pulses, legumes,
etc.); and the Science of Dietetics has made
such rapid progress in recent years that nuts and
grains are, for the benefit of those who possess
weakened digestive organs, now prepared in various
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
ways which make them easily digestible and very
savoury when cooked. To such foods may be added,
for the sake of convenience and variety, vegetables
of various kinds and dairy produce, such as milk,
butter, cheese and eggs.</p>



<p><span class="sidenote"><b>Personal
Testimony.</b></span>Nineteen years of abstinence from flesh-food
(practised without any illness, and
resulting in increased strength, stamina
and health), and of observation and
experiment during that period, combined with the
knowledge obtained through helping hundreds of
men and women to regain health by reforming
their habits of living, have convinced me that a well
selected fruitarian dietary, thus supplemented, will
prove beneficial to all who desire physical and mental
fitness. Temporary difficulties may be experienced
by some in adopting such a simple style of living,
or in obtaining adequate provision in their present
domestic conditions; mistakes may be made&mdash;certain
necessary elements being omitted from the new
diet&mdash;and temporary failure may sometimes result
in consequence; but if some preliminary study and
consideration are given to the matter, and <i>variety</i> in
the food is secured to ensure complete nourishment,
success is easily obtainable.</p>



<p><span class="sidenote"><b>A Step at
a Time.</b></span>In most cases where there is a desire
to adopt this purer and better way, it
will be found that the policy of proceeding
slowly but surely, a step at a
time, is the wisest in the end.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span></p>

<p>The first step must be total abstinence from the
flesh and blood of animals, and the substitution of
less objectionable food containing an equal amount
of proteid; this will soon lead to a distaste for fowl,
but the use of fish should be retained by those
commencing to reform their ways until some experience
has been gained, and any serious domestic
difficulties which may exist have been removed.
Then this partial vegetarian diet can be still further
purified, until it is more entirely "fruitarian" in its
nature. Circumstances, and individual sentiment
and taste, must regulate the rate of this progress
towards what may be termed Edenic living; I can
but show the way and give helpful information.</p>



<p><span class="sidenote"><b>Advantages
of Fruitarianism.</b></span>A few of the reasons which lead me to
advocate a fruitarian dietary as the
ideal one, are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Persons who live chiefly upon fruits
of all kinds do not injure themselves
by consuming the poisonous waste-products (uric
acid, &amp;c.), contained in flesh; and they are not
often tempted, like those who partake of very
savoury and toothsome dishes, to eat after the needs
of the body are satisfied. They thus escape two of
the chief causes of disease and premature death&mdash;<i>auto-intoxication
and excessive eating</i>. They also
avoid, to a great extent, the temptation to eat when
they are not hungry, and thus they are more likely
to obey the dictates of natural instinct concerning
<i>when to eat</i>. Even if fruit should be taken in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
excessive quantity, very little harm results from
such indiscretion.</p>

<p>Fruitarians thus lessen the amount of work put
upon the digestive organs, and consequently have
more energy to expend upon mental or physical
labour. The grape sugar contained in sweet fruits&mdash;such
as dates, figs, raisins and bananas&mdash;is
assimilated almost without effort and very quickly.</p>

<p>The juices of ripe fruits help to eliminate urates,
waste products, and other harmful deposits from
the blood and tissues, as they act as solvents.
Fruit, therefore, tends to prevent ossification of the
arteries, premature old age, gouty and rheumatic
disorders, sickness and untimely death.</p>

<p>Fruitarian diet&mdash;if scientifically chosen and containing
all the elements required by the body&mdash;prevents
the development of the "drink crave,"
and it will cure nearly all cases if properly and
wisely adopted. Dipsomania is induced by malnutrition,
by eating stimulating food, such as flesh,
or by eating to excess; a fruitarian drunkard has
not yet, so far as I am aware, been discovered in
this country.</p>

<p>Pure blood is secured by living upon such food,
and consequently there is little or no tendency to
develop <i>inflammatory</i> maladies. The wounds of
Turkish and Egyptian soldiers have been found to
heal three times as quickly as those of shamble-fed
Englishmen; the reason is that they live chiefly
upon dates, figs and other fruits, milk and lentils,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
etc.; and the same tendency has been observed
in the case of the Japanese wounded. A wonderful
immunity from sickness is enjoyed by those who
live in accord with Nature's plan; microbes and
disease germs do not find a congenial environment in
their bodies. This I have proved by nearly twenty
years of uninterrupted good health, and freedom
from medical attendance, and my experience is
corroborated by that of a multitude of witnesses in
the ranks of the food-reformers.</p>

<p>Fruitarian diet, if complete, tends to lessen
irritability, to promote benevolence and peace of
mind, to increase the supremacy of the 'higher self,'
to clear and strengthen spiritual perception, and to
lessen domestic care. Those who desire to develop
the higher spiritual powers which are latent in Man,
to cultivate the psychic or intuitive senses, and to
win their way to supremacy over their physical
limitations, will find fruitarianism helpful in every
respect. Such have only to <i>try it</i>, intelligently, in
order to prove that this is true.</p>

<p>Such a system of living may thus become an
important factor in the great work of uplifting our
race from the <i>animal</i> to the <i>spiritual</i> plane; and
herein lies the great hope for mankind. The
harbingers of the 'Coming Race'&mdash;a more spiritual
Race&mdash;are already treading this Earth, known and
recognized by those whose eyes have been opened
to the vision of the higher and transcendent life.
And that which tends to accelerate the development
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
of these characteristics is worthy of our serious
consideration and earnest advocacy.</p>

<p>Such a diet does not necessitate the horrible
cruelties of the cattle-boat and the slaughter-house&mdash;therefore
it must commend itself to every genuine
humanitarian.</p>

<p>It does not contain the germs of disease that
are found in the dead bodies of animals&mdash;frequently
afflicted with tuberculosis, cancer, foot-and-mouth-disease,
incipient anthrax, swine-fever and parasites
of various kinds.</p>

<p>It is free from that potent cause of physical
malady, uric acid&mdash;which is contained in all flesh;
and from "ptomaines,"&mdash;which develop in corpses
quickly after death and often prove fatal to consumers
of meat. And it will be found, if wisely
chosen, to produce a stronger body, a clearer brain,
and a purer mind.</p>

<p>The testimony of thousands of living advocates,
both in cold and warm climates&mdash;many of whom are
medical men, or athletes who have accomplished
record performances which demanded prolonged
endurance and unusual stamina&mdash;bears evidence
to this fact; therefore those who are desirous of
commencing this more excellent way of living need
not fear they are making any reckless or dangerous
experiment.</p>


<p>The food which our Creator <i>intended</i> us to eat
must be the <i>safest</i> and <i>best</i> for us. Man does not
resemble, either internally or externally, any
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
carnivorous animal, and no unprejudiced student of
the subject can well escape the conclusion that when
<span class="figleft" style="width: 260px;">
<img src="images/illus_019.png" width="260" height="200" alt="" />
</span>
we descend to the level of the
beasts of prey, by eating flesh, we
violate a physical Law of
our being, and run the
risk of incurring the inevitable
penalties which
Nature exacts for such
transgressions.</p>

<p>These penalties are
being lavishly dealt out with inexorable impartiality
in the civilized lands of the Western
world, where, in spite of the rapid increase of our
medical men, and the 'wonderful discoveries' of
panaceas by the representatives of unscrupulous
pathological search, such maladies as appendicitis,
consumption, cancer, lunacy, gout, neurasthenia
and other evidences of physical deterioration are
still prevalent or steadily increasing.</p>

<p>And, although the fact is not so apparent to the
superficial observer, a still heavier penalty in the
form of spiritual loss is being suffered by those who
err in this respect, for <i>carnal food</i> produces <i>carnal-mindedness</i>,
dims the spiritual vision, chains the soul
to the material plane of thought and consciousness,
and makes the supremacy of the 'spirit' over the
'flesh' well-nigh impossible.</p>

<p>It is natural for every man and woman to live at
least a century. The fact that thousands have done
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
so, proves that the majority might attain this age if
they would cease from transgressing Nature's laws.
Seneca truly said, "Man does not die, he kills himself."</p>

<p>By "eating to live," instead of "living to eat"&mdash;introducing
into our bodies pure and vitalizing energy
by means of wisely chosen natural food&mdash;and by
amending our ways generally in accordance with the
dictates of reason and common sense, we may live
to benefit the world by useful service with our
faculties matured and our minds stored by the teachings
of experience. Instead of being in our dotage
when we reach threescore years and ten, we should
still be fit to serve our day and generation.</p>



<p><span class="sidenote"><b>The
Highest
Motive.</b></span>Those who decide to adopt this reformed
system of diet will be fortified in their
resolve if they are actuated by loyalty to
the Divine Will and regard for Humane
Principle, in addition to reasons which are based
merely upon self-interest. The desire to lessen
suffering, and to live in accordance with God's laws,
furnishes a stronger incentive than the wish to escape
disease and to secure longevity.</p>

<p>A philanthropist or humanitarian who embraces
the sublime ideal of helping to lift mankind to a
higher plane of experience, to deliver our degenerate
Race from some of the worst evils which afflict us,
and, at the same time, to prevent the infliction of pain
and death in most revolting forms upon countless
millions of innocent animals, will either conquer the
initial difficulties which confront those who thus make
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
practical protest against the flesh traffic, or will
cheerfully endure temporary inconvenience and self-denial
"for Righteousness' sake."</p>

<p>Each new recruit who joins the Food-Reform
Movement should therefore give such preliminary
study to the subject as will produce the unalterable
conviction that flesh-eating is an <i>unnatural</i> habit for
Man, that it is totally <i>unnecessary</i>, that reliable
medical evidence proves it to be generally <i>injurious</i>,
and that it involves cruelty and bloodshed which are
barbarous and indefensible, <i>because quite needless</i>.</p>

<p>A deaf ear will then be turned to the warnings of
any well-disposed friends who, being under the spell
of ancient fallacies, or ignorant concerning the nutritive
advantages which the fruits of the earth possess over
the products of the shambles, would seek to deter
him from the path of self-reform by prophesying
physical shipwreck and disaster.</p>

<p>Popular illusions concerning the necessity for
animal food are rapidly being swept away, and
public opinion has already changed to such an extent
that leaders of thought in every land are now
impressed with the full import and beneficence of
this Reformation. And so many forces are now converging
and combining to influence and impel mankind
in this direction, that the 'signs of the times'
indicate a rapidly approaching Era in which Man
will return to his original food, and, by so doing,
enter upon a happier and more peaceful period of
existence upon this planet.</p>

<h2>A PLEA FOR THE SIMPLE LIFE.</h2>


<p>Simple meals and simple dishes are easily prepared,
they lessen domestic care, are less likely to cause
<span class="figleft" style="width: 176px;">
<img src="images/illus_022.png" width="176" height="200" alt="" />
</span>
indigestion, and soon become
appreciated and preferred.</p>

<p>Few persons realize how
little they know the true
taste of many vegetables; the
majority having never eaten
them <i>separately</i> or cooked in a
proper manner. A cauliflower
skilfully served as a separate
course, either "au gratin" or
with thin melted butter slightly
flavoured with a few drops of Tarragon vinegar, or
with tomato sauce, has quite a different taste from
that which is experienced when it is mixed up with
gravy, meat, potatoes and other articles or food.</p>

<p>Young green peas, or new potatoes steamed in
their skins and dried off in the oven so as to be
"floury," will, if eaten with a little salt and butter,
have a delicacy of flavour which is scarcely noticeable
if they are served with a plate of beef or mutton and
other vegetables. A few chestnuts carefully cooked
in a similar manner, make a dish that an overfed
alderman might enjoy; and the same remark will
apply to many simple and easily prepared fruitarian
dishes.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span></p>
<p>It is a mistake to think that this reformed diet
necessarily involves a great amount of cooking,
for the reverse is the fact if <i>simplicity</i> is aimed at
and its advantages are appreciated. It is well to
remember also that our most enlightened and progressive
physicians are now recommending uncooked
foods of all kinds to all who would retain or regain
health.</p>

<p>An excellent lunch can be made with some well
chosen cheese and brown bread and butter, and a
delicate lettuce (dressed with pure olive oil, a small
quantity of French wine vinegar, and a pinch of
sugar), followed by fresh and dried fruits such as
bananas, almonds, raisins, figs, etc. Such a repast
is inexpensive, nutritious, and easily digestible. A
large variety of foreign and fancy cheeses are now
obtainable, so that even such a simple meal as this
can be varied constantly. The best lettuces are
produced by our French neighbours, but our own
market gardeners are beginning to learn that it is
easy to get them tender by growing them under glass.</p>



<p><span class="sidenote"><b>The
Simple
Breakfast.</b></span>In most fruitarian households the cooking
for breakfast soon becomes simplified
and lessened. Eggs served in
different ways on alternate mornings,
fresh and dried fruits, nuts, brown bread, super
cooked cereals such as granose biscuit, butter and
preserves, are found to be quite sufficient as
accompaniments to the morning beverage. French
plums, figs and other dried fruits, when carefully
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
stewed in the oven for some hours, and served
with cream, are very nutritious. A small plate of
'Manhu' wheat, rye, barley, or oat flakes, served
with hot milk or cream, can be added so as to
make a more solid meal for growing children or
hard workers. And those who are accustomed to a
more elaborate breakfast, because of the difficulty of
obtaining a mid-day substantial meal, can select
one of the items which are mentioned in the list
of recipes under the heading of "Breakfast Dishes."</p>



<p><span class="sidenote"><b>Avoid
Dyspepsia.</b></span>One reason for urging simplicity is
that, owing to prevalent ignorance concerning
food-values, it is more easy
for the <i>inexperienced</i> food-reformer to
make dietetic mistakes than the flesh-eater.</p>

<p>By partaking freely of stewed acid fruits and
vegetables at the same meal, or by blending a great
variety of savouries, vegetables, sweets and rich
fatty dishes together in a ghastly 'pot pourri,'
or by eating to excess of porridge, beans, or
fried dishes, many have made serious blunders.
They, for want of proper instruction, have hastily
come to the conclusion that "vegetarian diet does
not suit them," and returning to the flesh-pots,
have henceforth denounced the evangel of dietetic
reform, instead of profiting by the useful lesson
Nature tried to teach them.</p>

<p>The wisest plan is to make one's diet generally
<i>as varied as possible</i>, but not to mix many articles
together <i>at the same meal</i>.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span></p>
<p>Abstainers from flesh should begin to live to some
extent (say two days a week) in picnic style, and the
practice will soon become more habitual. A picnic
luncheon which is considered enjoyable in the woods
or on the moors will be found to be just as nice at
home if the articles provided are well chosen and
tastefully prepared. Variety can be obtained by
introducing daintily cut sandwiches made with mustard
and cress, tomato paste, potted haricots, or
lentils, scrambled eggs, fancy cheese cut thinly,
flaked nuts and honey, etc. Fresh and dried fruit,
nuts, almonds, raisins and sultanas, fruit cakes, and
custard or rice puddings, provide useful additions;
and it will soon be found that the old-fashioned three
or four-course meal which involves such laborious
preparation is a needless addition to life's many cares.</p>


<p><span class="sidenote"><b>Necessary
Elements
in Food.</b></span>
It is important to bear in mind that our
daily food must contain a sufficient
quantity of certain necessary elements:</p>

<p>(1) <span class="smcap">Protein.</span> To be found in nuts
and nut foods (such as Protose, Nuttoria
and Fibrose, &amp;c.), eggs, cheese, brown bread,
oatmeal, haricots, lentils and peas.</p>

<p>(2) <span class="smcap">Fat.</span> To be obtained in nuts, nut-butters,
olive oil, cheese, milk, cream, butter, and oatmeal.</p>

<p>(3) <span class="smcap">Phosphates and Mineral Salts.</span> Contained
in the husk of wheat, barley, oats, and rye
(therefore included in brown bread, granose biscuits
and other whole-wheat or cereal preparations),
cheese, bananas and apples.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span></p>
<p>(4) <span class="smcap">Sugar.</span> To be obtained from all starch
foods, but most easily and in the best and most
readily assimilable form from sweet fruits and honey.</p>
<hr />
<h2>A PLEA FOR MODERATION.</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>ne of the most frequent mistakes made by those
who commence to live upon a fleshless diet is
that of eating too much&mdash;an error, also committed
<span class="figleft" style="width: 194px;">
<img src="images/illus_026.png" width="194" height="200" alt="Do not dig your grave with your teeth!" />
</span>by the general public.
Often, through ignorance of
the fact that lean beef consists
of water to the extent of about
75%, and through having been
brought up under the spell of
the popular delusion that meat
is a great source of strength
and stamina, they jump to the
conclusion that they must consume large plates of
cereals and vegetables in order to make up for their
abstinence from animal food. They bring upon
themselves severe attacks of dyspepsia&mdash;either by
eating excessive quantities of starch in the form of
porridge, bread and potatoes, or of such concentrated
foods as haricots, lentils or nuts (being ignorant of
the fact that these latter are much more nutritious
than lean beef and that only a very small quantity is
needed for a sufficient meal).<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span></p>
<p>Nothing does more injury to the Food-Reform
Movement than the discredit which is brought upon
it by those who upset themselves by over-eating, and
who feel led to justify their defection by attacking
the system they have forsaken. Among the numerous
cases brought to my notice, I remember one of a
minister's wife, who by partaking of seven meals a
day, and finishing up at ten o'clock in the evening
with cocoa, cheese and porridge, brought herself to
such a state of nervous prostration that her local
doctor ordered her to return to a flesh diet, "as she
required <i>nourishment</i>." He thus diagnosed her condition,
instead of attributing it to preposterous over-feeding.</p>

<p>A Golden Rule for every food-reformer is this&mdash;<i>Eat
only when you are hungry</i>, and never to
repletion. An exception must be made, however,
in certain cases of anæmic and delicate persons.
When there is not sufficient vitality to cause
appetite, or to digest food normally, it is often
necessary to insist on regular meals being taken,
notwithstanding the patient's distaste for food.
Drowsiness and stupor after a meal are sure signs
of excess, and I cannot too strongly urge
temperance in diet. During my long experience of
philanthropic work as an advocate of natural and
hygienic living, I have only heard of a few cases of
persons suffering any ill effects from eating too little,
whereas cases of the opposite sort have been rather
numerous. Ninety-nine per cent. of the centenarians
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
of the world have been characterized by <i>abstemiousness</i>;
however much their ways and customs may have
otherwise differed, in this one respect they are practically
alike&mdash;declaring that they have always been
small eaters, and believers in moderation in all
things.</p>

<hr />
<h2>ARTISTIC COOKERY.</h2>


<p>In every household where reformed diet is
adopted, effort should be made to prepare the
meals in an artistic manner. If a dish is skilfully
cooked and tastefully served it is not only
more enjoyable but more easily digested.</p>

<p><span class="figleft" style="width: 166px;">
<img src="images/illus_028.png" width="166" height="200" alt="A Cook." />
</span>The general custom in English homes is to serve vegetables
in a rather slovenly style. To see how nicely such things as
legumes, vegetables, salads and fruits can be prepared, one
requires to go to a good French or
Italian restaurant. But it is quite easy
for us to learn the ways of our friends
abroad, and to make our dishes look
tempting and appetising.</p>

<p>One of the first lessons to be learned by the vegetarian
cook is how to fry rissoles, potatoes, etc., <i>quite
crisp</i>, and free from any flavour of oil or fat. To
do this a wire basket which will fit loosely into a
stewpan is necessary, and it can be purchased at any
good ironmonger's shop. Nutter (refined coconut
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
butter) is a well prepared form of vegetable fat, and
it is retailed at a moderate price; it keeps for a long
period and is equally useful for making pastry&mdash;three
quarters of a pound being equal to one pound
of butter. Where nut-butters cannot be obtained,
good olive oil should be used.</p>

<p>The temperature of the fat or oil must be past
boiling point, and should reach about 380 degrees.
When it is hot enough it will quickly turn a small
piece of white bread quite brown, if a finger of it is
dipped in the fat. Unless this temperature is reached
the articles to be fried may turn out greasy and unbearable.
If the fat is heated very much beyond 400
degrees it may take fire. Haricots, lentils, and
many other legumes are more tasty if made into
cutlets or rissoles and fried in this manner, after being
mixed with breadcrumbs and seasoning, than if
merely boiled or stewed in the usual crude style.</p>


<p><span class="sidenote"><b>The Art of
Flavouring.</b></span>
The art of flavouring is also one which
should be studied by every housewife.
By making tasty gravies and sauces
many a dish which would otherwise be
insipid can be rendered attractive. The recipes for
"Gravies" will prove useful on this point.</p>

<p>Many valuable modern scientific food products are
not fully appreciated because people do not know
how to serve them. Take 'Protose,' 'Nuttoria' and
'Nuttose' for instance&mdash;very useful substitutes for
flesh which are made from nuts (malted and therefore
half digested). If <i>slightly</i> stewed, and eaten without
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
any flavouring, some persons dislike the distinctive
taste; if, however, they are well cooked, according
to the recipes printed later on in this book, and
served with such garnishings as are recommended,
they are usually much enjoyed, even by those who
are prejudiced against all vegetarian ideas.</p>



<p><span class="sidenote"><b>Cooking
by Gas
saves
Labour.</b></span>Cooking by gas appliances is more
easily controlled and regulated than
when the old-fashioned fire is employed,
and much labour for stoking and cleaning
is avoided. Those who can do so,
should obtain a gas hot-plate, consisting of two or
three spiral burners, and a moderate-sized gas oven.
If they cannot afford the ordinary gas cooking oven,
a smaller substitute can be obtained, which can be
placed upon any gas jet; this is very economical for
cooking single dishes, and for warming plates, etc.
A gas cooking jet can be obtained for eighteenpence,
and two or three of these will take the place of a
hot-plate if economy is necessary. In summer-time
the kitchen range is quite a superfluity unless it is
required for heating bath water.</p>



<p><span class="sidenote"><b>A New
Mission
for Women.</b></span>The ordinary public know very little of
the variety and delicacy of a well chosen
fruitarian dietary when thoughtfully
prepared; ignorance and prejudice consequently
cause thousands to turn a deaf ear to the
evangel of Food-Reform. All women who desire to
bring about the abolition of Butchery, and to hasten
the Humane Era, should therefore educate themselves
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
in artistic fruitarian cookery, and then help to
instruct others.</p>

<p>To illustrate the truth of these remarks I may
mention that at a banquet given by the Arcadian
Lodge of Freemasons, at the Hotel Cecil, in London&mdash;the
first Masonic Lodge which passed a resolution
to banish animal-flesh from all its banquets&mdash;one of
the Chief Officers of the Grand Lodge of England
attended. He came filled with prejudice against
the innovation and prepared to criticise the repast
most unfavourably. In his after-dinner speech,
however, he admitted that it was one of the best
Masonic banquets he had ever attended, and said
that if what if he had enjoyed was "vegetarian
diet," he was prepared to adopt it if he found it
possible to get it provided at home.</p>

<p>By practising the recipes which are given in the
following pages, and by utilizing the hints which
accompany them, readers of this book will find no
difficulty in acquiring the skill which is requisite to
win many from the flesh-pots, even when they cannot
be induced to abandon them from any higher motives
than self-interest or gustatory enjoyment.</p>

<p>Every woman should resolve to learn how to feed
her children with pure and harmless food. Every
mother should make her daughters study this art
and thus educate them to worthily fulfil their
domestic responsibilities. Here is a new profession
for women&mdash;for teachers of high-class fruitarian and
hygienic cookery will soon be greatly in demand.</p>
<hr />
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span></p>

<h2>WHAT TO DO WHEN TRAVELLING.</h2>

<p>The difficulty of being properly catered for when
staying at Hotels was formerly a very real one, but
owing to the enlightenment concerning diet which is
now taking place, and the rapid increase of foreign
restaurants and cafés in English-speaking countries
<span class="figleft" style="width: 100px;">
<img src="images/illus_032.png" width="100" height="174" alt="" />
</span>
it is becoming lessened every day. The
great variety of fleshless dishes now
supplied in nearly all light-refreshment
restaurants, in response to the public
demand, is compelling even the largest
Hotels to modify their cuisine accordingly.</p>

<p>For breakfast it is sometimes a good
plan to order what one wants the previous night, if
any specially cooked dishes are required, but it is <i>not</i>
advisable to inform the waiter that one is a vegetarian.
It is generally possible to obtain porridge,
grilled tomatoes on toast, poached or fried eggs,
stewed mushrooms, etc., without giving extra
trouble or exciting comment. Where these cannot
be obtained, a plain breakfast of brown bread or
toast and butter, with eggs, preserves and fruit
should be taken.</p>

<p>At large hotels in our chief cities a Restaurant
and a Grill Room are provided. The food-reformer
should go to one of these for his dinner, rather than
to the dining room, as he will then be able to obtain
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
various simple <i>à la carte</i> dishes. One 'portion' of any
particular dish will often suffice for two persons,
thus enabling those whose means are limited to
obtain greater variety without increasing expenditure.
Care has to be exercised, however, concerning
certain dishes; for instance, if macaroni is required,
it is well to ask the waiter to request the cook
not to introduce any chopped ham. He should be
told that you wish macaroni served with tomato
sauce and cheese only, in the "Neapolitan" style.</p>

<p>In most Continental Hotels and Restaurants the
simplest, cheapest, and best plan is to take 'table
d'hôte'&mdash;telling the head waiter well beforehand
that the lunch or dinner is required 'maigre' (that
is without flesh, just as it is usually served during
Lent). A varied, well selected, and ample repast
will then be supplied at a moderate cost. The same
plan is best in 'Pensions.'</p>

<p>The general rule to be adopted in small British
hotels is to think beforehand what dishes the cook
is in the habit of making which are free from flesh;
these should be ordered in preference to those which
are strange and not likely to be understood. At the
same time it is well to insist upon being supplied
with anything which it is reasonable to expect the
proprietor to furnish, because such action tends to
improve the catering of the hotels of the country, to
make it easier for other food-reformers, and to
sweep away the difficulty which at present exists in
some towns, of obtaining anything fit to eat in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
orthodox hotel coffee rooms, except beasts, birds,
or fishes.</p>


<p><span class="sidenote"><b>Railway
Journeys.</b></span>
Those who are making railway journeys
can easily provide themselves with a
simple luncheon basket containing
fruits, sandwiches made with flaked nuts, eggs,
cheese or preserves, or with such delicacies as haricot
or lentil potted meat (directions for making which will
be found later on, in the section devoted to Luncheon
Recipes.) Travellers may perhaps be reminded
that cheese and nuts contain much more nutriment
than lean meat.</p>

<p>Food-reformers who are about to pay a prolonged
visit in a private house should inform the hostess,
when accepting her invitation, that they are abstainers
from flesh, but that their tastes are very
simple and that they enjoy anything except flesh
food. As she might have erroneous ideas about
the requirements of vegetarians she might otherwise
feel perplexed as to what to provide. If the visitor
takes fish the fact should be stated.</p>


<p><span class="sidenote"><b>No
Faddism.</b></span>
Care should be taken not to involve the
hostess in any needless trouble, and
she should be shown, by the simplicity
of one's requirements, that she is easily capable of
affording complete satisfaction. When she realizes
this, she will probably take pleasure in learning something
about hygienic living, and will be ready to
read a pamphlet or a guide-book upon the subject,
and to produce some of the dishes contained in it.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span></p>
<p>The Humane Diet Cause has been much hindered
by the 'fads' of persons who have adopted
very extreme views about diet and who worry
themselves and other people about trifling matters
in connection with their food until they are almost
regarded as being pests in a household. Instead of
cheerfully partaking of anything that is provided,
except flesh, they parade their scruples about almost
everything on the table, and, consequently, those
who entertain them vow that they will never become
such nuisances themselves or entertain such again.</p>

<p>I have always found that by letting my friends
clearly understand that I abstain from butchered
flesh chiefly because of <i>humane reasons</i> and for the
sake of <i>principle</i>, they respect my sentiment, and
evince a desire to discuss the matter without
prejudice. If fruitarianism is adopted merely as a
'fad,' discordant vibrations are often aroused
because one's acquaintances consider that one is
giving needless trouble by being unconventional
without sufficient justification.</p>


<p><span class="sidenote"><b>Sea Voyages.</b></span>
Those who are making a sea voyage
will find that many of the large steamship
companies are quite prepared to
furnish substitutes for flesh-diet if an
arrangement is made beforehand. In such cases
there should be a clear stipulation that brown bread,
dried and fresh fruit, nuts, farinaceous puddings,
omelets, or dishes made with cheese, macaroni,
lentils, haricots, tomatoes, etc., should be obtainable
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
in some form and in sufficient variety. A list of a
few 'specialities' (such as Protose, Nuttoria, &amp;c.)
should be furnished when a long voyage is contemplated,
so that the steward may stock them.</p>
<hr />
<h2>ADVICE FOR BEGINNERS.</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>he following suggestions will prove helpful to
those who are desirous of adopting the reformed
dietary:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. Give up flesh meat <i>at once</i> and <i>entirely</i>&mdash;replacing
it by dishes made with eggs, cheese,
macaroni, peas, lentils, nuts, and nut-meats.
<span class="figleft" style="width: 106px;">
<img src="images/illus_036.png" width="106" height="200" alt="" />
</span>Later on you will be able to do without fish
also, but it is best to proceed slowly and
surely.</p>

<p>2. Eat <i>less</i> rather than <i>more</i>. Fruitarian
foods such as the above are more
nourishing than butcher's meat.</p>

<p>3. Try to like <i>simple</i> foods, instead of
elaborate dishes that require much preparation.
Avoid 'frying-panitis.'</p>

<p>4. Eat dry foods rather than sloppy ones; they
are more easily digested. Take toast or Granose
biscuits with porridge to assist proper salivation. If
porridge causes trouble, use wheat or rye flakes
(Manhu or Kellogg brands), with hot milk or cream,
instead.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span></p>
<p>5. Do not mix stewed acid fruits with vegetables
and legumes; take the former with cereals, cheese,
or eggs. Green vegetables should be taken very
sparingly, and with savoury dishes alone. If eaten
with sweets they are apt to disagree.</p>

<p>6. Persons of sedentary habits should let at
least one meal a day consist of uncooked fruit only&mdash;or
of fruit with brown bread and butter&mdash;the bread
being <i>well baked</i>.</p>

<p>7. Dried fruits, such as figs, dates, prunes,
raisins, sultanas, etc., are very easily digested; and
if blended with nuts or almonds they make a perfect
meal. Such fruits may be taken freely and with
advantage by almost everyone.</p>

<p>8. Nuts should be flaked in a nut-mill to aid digestion;
cheese can also be made more easily assimilable
in this way (or by cooking). Many nut products are
now sold which are malted and partially pre-digested.</p>

<p>9. Give a few hours' thought and study to the
important subject of your diet; learn what to do,
and what newly-invented scientific foods are
obtainable.</p>

<p>10. Do not make the mistake of attempting to
live on potatoes, white bread, cabbages, etc., or
merely upon the ordinary conventional dietary with the
meat left out. Obtain and use well made and well
cooked wholemeal bread every day. Take sufficient
<i>proteid</i>, 1½ to 2-ozs. per day, to avoid anæmia&mdash;indigestion
often results from <i>lack of vitality</i> caused
through chronic semi-starvation.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span></p>
<p>11. If you feel any symptoms of dyspepsia,
and can trace it to <i>excess</i> in eating, or to dietetic
errors, reduce your food, fast temporarily, and take
more exercise. Consider what mistakes you have
made, and avoid them in the future. Eat only when
hungry, in such cases.</p>

<p>12. If you are not getting on, obtain advice
from a Doctor who is a <i>fruitarian</i> or from an
experienced Food-reformer.</p>
<hr />
<h2><b>Commercial Dietetic Inventions.</b></h2>

<p><span class="dropcap">A</span> large number of special proprietary substitutes for
animal food can now be obtained to supplement
the ordinary ones provided in the household. The
latest particulars concerning these can always be
known by reference to the advertisement pages of
<i>The Herald of the Golden Age</i>, and full information
as to their use is supplied by the various manufacturers.
But although they are <i>useful</i> and <i>convenient</i>
in many households, they are not <i>absolutely
essential</i>. 'Home-made' dishes are often the best,
being most economical, therefore it is advisable that
all food-reformers should learn how to make nut-meats,
&amp;c., at home. Some of these substitutes are
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p><b>For Meat-Extracts</b>: Marmite, Vegeton, Carnos,
Nutril, Mapleton's Gravy Essence, Cayler's Extract,
Wintox.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span></p>
<p><b>For Joints of Meat</b>: Protose, Nuttose, Savrose,
Fibrose, F.R. Nut-Meat, Vejola, Nuttoria, Shearn's
Nut-Meat, Nutton, Brazose, Nuto-Cream Meat,
Mapleton's Frittamix.</p>

<p><b>For Cold Meats</b>: "Pitman" Nut-Meat Brawn,
Ellis's Tomato and Nut Paste, Pasta-sol, Lentose,
Nuska Viando, Savoury Paste, Potted Beans and
Lentils.</p>

<p><b>For Meat Fat</b>: Nutter Suet, Vegsu, Nutter,
Nucoline, and Nut Margarine.</p>

<p>Pine Kernels, which contain 10 ozs. of oil to the
pound, and which when rolled and chopped exactly
resemble suet, are also an excellent substitute.</p>

<p>Delicious Nut-Butters are also now obtainable
for high-class cookery&mdash;such as Almond, Walnut,
Cashew, and Table Nutter. Although superior,
these are as cheap as ordinary cooking butters.</p>

<p><b>For Lard and Dripping</b>: Nutter, Darlene,
Albene, Nut-oil, "Pitman" Vegetable Lard.</p>

<p><b>For Meat proteid</b>: Emprote, Hygiama, Horlick's
Malted Milk, Casumen Dried Milk, Gluten
Meal.</p>

<p><b>For Gelatine</b>: Agar-Agar, or Cayler's Jellies.</p>

<p><b>For Animal Soups</b>: Mapleton's Nut and proteid
Soups, and "Pitman" Vegsal Soups.</p>

<p><b>Prepared Breakfast Cereals</b>: Manhu flaked
Wheat, Rye, Barley and Oats, Kellogg Wheat and
Corn Flakes, Granose Flakes and Biscuits, Shredded
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
Wheat, Archeva Rusks, Puffed Wheat, Power,
Kornules, Toasted Wheat Flakes, Melarvi Crisps

<p><b>For Picnic Hampers</b>: Savage's Nut Foods
or Cream o' Nuts, Wallace Cakes and Scones,
Mapleton's Nut Meats, Winter's Nut Cream Rolls,
"Pitman" Fruit and Nut Cakes and Nut Meat
Brawn, Wallace P. R. or Ixion or Artox or
"Pitman" Biscuits.</p>

<p><b>Meat Stock</b> is substituted by vegetable stock,
produced by stewing haricots, peas, lentils, etc. The
latter is far more nutritious, and is free from the uric
acid and excrementitious matter that are present in
meat decoctions. A tasty and meaty flavour can be
at once given to soups or gravies by adding some
vegetable meat-extract selected from one of the
varieties already mentioned.</p>

<hr />

<p>In the following pages recipes will be found for
preparing dishes which closely resemble, in taste,
appearance, and nutritive value, those to which the
community have been accustomed, some of them being
of such a nature that persons who are fond of
flesh-food find it difficult to detect whether they are
eating such or not.</p>

<h2>RELATIVE VALUES OF FOODS.</h2>


<p class="center"><b>How to Regulate our Diet.</b></p>

<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>ur food must contain certain elements, and in
proper quantity, if the body is to be well sustained,
renewed and nourished. These are mainly as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="indent">1. Protein to form flesh, build muscle, and
produce strength.</p>

<p class="indent">2. Fat and Carbohydrates, to provide heat and
energy.</p>

<p class="indent">3. Salts and minerals (such as phosphates, lime,
iron, citrates, etc.) to build bones and teeth,
feed the brain and nerves, and purify the body.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No hard-and-fast table or rule can be laid down
concerning the proper proportions in which these
elements should be combined, because the amount
needful for each individual varies according to his
size, the sort of work he does, the amount of physical
or mental energy he puts forth, and the temperature
of the atmosphere surrounding him.</p>

<p>Until Professor Chittenden made his extensive
and conclusive series of experiments in America, in
1903-4, to determine the real amount of Protein and
other elements required to keep the body in perfect
health, the average estimate for a person of average
size, who does a moderate amount of physical
labour, was about 4-ozs. of Protein per day.</p>

<p>But these official experiments, conducted with
scientific precision, extending over a long period,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
and made with thirty-four typical and carefully
graded representatives of physical and mental work,
demonstrated that half this amount of Protein is
sufficient, and that strength and health are increased
when the quantity is thus reduced; also that a
smaller amount of Carbohydrate food (bread, etc.),
than was previously thought necessary, is enough.</p>

<p>One may therefore now safely reckon that men
of average size and weight (say 10 to 12 stone)
doing a moderate amount of physical and mental
work, can thrive under ordinary circumstances on a
daily ration containing about 800 grains of Protein
(nearly 2 ozs).</p>

<p>The following food chart will enable the reader
to calculate (approximately) how much food of any
particular kind is necessary to provide the above
amount. Adult persons below the average size and
weight, and living sedentary rather than an active
physical life, will naturally require less than this
normal standard. The relative cost and economy of
the different foods can also thus be ascertained.</p>

<p>If care is taken to secure a sufficient quantity of
Protein the requisite amount of Carbohydrates is not
likely to be omitted, and hunger will prove a reliable
guide in most cases. It is advisable, however, to
see that enough Fat is taken, especially in winter,
and by persons lacking in nerve force.</p>

<p>The table of food-values will easily enable the
reader to ascertain the proportion of Fat in each
kind of food.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span></p>
<p>The following indications of dietetic error may
prove useful:&mdash;</p>


<p><span class="sidenote"><b>Signs of
Dietetic
Mistakes.</b></span>
Excess of proteid matter causes a
general sense of plethora and unbearableness,
nervous prostration or drowsiness
after meals, a tendency to
congestion (often resulting in piles, etc.), headache,
irritability, and bad temper. A continuous
deficiency of it would tend to produce general weakness
and anæmia.</p>

<p>Excess of carbohydrate matter (starch), especially
if not sufficiently cooked and not well masticated,
produces dyspepsia, flatulence, pain in the chest and
abdomen, acidity (resulting in pimples and boils),
and an inflammatory state of the system. Deficiency
of it (or its equivalent, grape sugar) would produce
lack of force and physical exhaustion.</p>

<p>Excess of fat tends to cause biliousness. Deficiency
of it results in nervous weakness, neuralgia,
and low temperature of the body.</p>


<p><span class="sidenote"><b>Food for
Brain
Workers.</b></span>
It is important to remember that the
more <i>physical</i> energy we put forth,
the larger is the amount of proteid
we require in our diet&mdash;and vice versa.
Brain workers of sedentary habits require but little
proteid, and quickly suffer from indigestion if this
is taken too freely. For such, a very simple dietary
consisting largely of dried and fresh fruits, nuts
(flaked or ground), milk, eggs and cheese, and
<i>super-cooked</i> cereals (such as wholemeal biscuits,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
and toast, Granose and Kellogg flakes, and well
baked rice dishes) will be found to be the most
suitable.</p>

<p>In order to supply the brain with phosphates it is
very important that mental workers should take
whole wheat bread instead of the emasculated white
substitute which is provided almost everywhere. It is
the outer part of the grain that provides brain-food
(combined with an <i>easily assimilable</i> form of protein),
and many of our urban bread winners break down
because they are deprived of the essential food
elements therein contained. To take 'standard'
bread does not meet the case, and every food-reformer
who wants to keep really fit should demand
and obtain well baked and unadulterated wholemeal
bread. I feel convinced that if every growing child
and every mental toiler could always be supplied
with bread of this type, the deterioration of our
British race would soon be arrested and we should
witness signs of physical regeneration. 'Artox' and
'Ixion' brands of pure whole wheatmeal are the
most perfect I know of at the present time, and
delicious bread can easily be made from them if
the recipe printed on page <a href="#Page_114">114</a> is followed.</p>

<h2>VEGETARIAN SOUPS.</h2>

<p class="center large"><b>VEGETABLE STOCK.</b></p>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>he best stock for vegetable soups is made from
haricot beans. Take a pound of these, pick and
wash well, and soak for 10 or 12 hours in cold
water. Put them in a saucepan with the water in
which they were soaked, add a few of the coarser
stalks of celery, 1 or 2 chopped Spanish onions, a
blade of mace, and a few white peppercorns. If
celery is not in season, use celery salt. Bring to a
boil, skim, and cook gently for at least 2 hours.
Then strain, and use as required.</p>


<p class="center large"><b><a name="r1" id="r1">1</a>. Artichoke Soup.</b></p>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>ake 2-lbs. of white artichokes, 3-pts. of water, 3
large onions, a piece of celery (or some celery
salt), ¼-pt. of raw cream or 1-pt. of milk. Boil
together for 45 minutes, strain through a fine sieve
and serve. If cream is used it should not be added
until after the soup is cooked.</p>


<p class="center large"><b><a name="r2" id="r2">2</a>. Chestnut Soup.</b></p>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>ake 1-lb. chestnuts, 1 or 2 onions, 1½-pints
vegetable stock, 1-oz. nut-butter.</p>

<p>Boil the chestnuts for 15 minutes and peel them;
put these with the onions (sliced) into a roomy stewpan,
with the butter, and fry briskly for 5 minutes;
now add the stock, with seasoning to taste, and bring
to the boil. Simmer gently until onions and chestnuts
are quite soft, and pass all through a hair sieve.
Dilute with milk until the consistency of thin cream,
and serve with <i>croûtons</i>.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span></p>

<p class="center large"><b>3. Rich Gravy Soup.</b></p>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>o 3-pts. of haricot stock add 1 onion and 1 carrot
(fried with butter until brown), 1 stick of celery,
2 turnips and 6 peppercorns, and thicken with cornflour.
Boil all together for 1 hour, strain, return to
saucepan, and add 3 small teaspoons of Marmite.
Warm it up, but <i>not to boiling point</i>. Serve with
fried bread dice. This soup, if well made, is equal
to anything that a French chef can produce.</p>


<p class="center large"><b><a name="r4" id="r4">4</a>. Mock Turtle Soup.</b></p>

<p><span class="dropcap">F</span>ry 6 good-sized onions in 1-oz. of butter till nicely
browned, then add 2 breakfastcups of German
lentils, a good handful of spinach leaves, a few
capers, about 6 chillies, and 3 pints of water. Let
this simmer for 2 or 3 hours, then strain off, add 2
tablespoons of tapioca which has been soaked for an
hour or two. Boil till perfectly clear. When ready
for serving add salt to taste and 1 teaspoonful of
Nutril. Some small custard quenelles should be put in
the tureen&mdash;made by beating 1 egg in 2-ozs. flour and
adding ¼-pt. milk. Bake until firm and cut into dice.</p>


<p class="center large"><b><a name="r5" id="r5">5</a>. Brown Haricot Soup.</b></p>

<p><span class="dropcap">B</span>oil ½-lb. beans in 2-qts. of water. When the
beans crack, add a few tomatoes, 1 leek sliced,
or a Spanish onion, and a bunch of herbs. Boil
until the vegetables are tender, adding a little more
water if necessary. Rub all through a sieve, and
return to pan, adding seasoning, a good lump of
butter, and the juice of half a small lemon after the
soup has boiled. If a richer soup is required add
two teaspoonfuls of Nuto-Cream or Marmite just
before serving.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span></p>

<p class="center large"><b><a name="r6" id="r6">6</a>. Tomato Soup.</b></p>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>ake a pound of tomatoes, a sliced onion, and 2-ozs.
of tapioca (previously soaked for some hours).
Boil for an hour, then add salt, pepper, and a little
butter. Mix ½-pt. of milk with a teaspoonful of flour;
add this to the soup, stir and boil for 5 minutes.</p>


<p class="center large"><b>7. Egyptian Lentil Soup.</b></p>

<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>ash and pick ½-lb. Egyptian lentils and put on to
boil in about 1-qt. of water. Add 1 sliced onion,
1 carrot, 1 turnip, a small bunch of herbs, and celery
salt, and boil gently about 1 hour. Rub through a
sieve, return to pan, add 1-oz. butter and a cupful
of milk. Bring to boil and serve.</p>


<p class="center large"><b><a name="r8" id="r8">8</a>. Brazil Nut Soup.</b></p>

<p><span class="dropcap">P</span>ass 1 pint of shelled Brazil nuts through a nut
mill, fry these with one or two chopped onions
in 1-oz. of nut-butter, keeping them a pale yellow
colour; add 1-oz. flour, and gradually 1½-pts. of
white stock; bring slowly to the boil and simmer
gently until the onions are soft. Pass through a
hair sieve, and dilute with milk.</p>


<p class="center large"><b><a name="r9" id="r9">9</a>. Julienne Soup.</b></p>

<p><span class="dropcap">C</span>ut some carrots, turnips, onions, celery, and leeks
into thin strips, using double quantity of carrots
and turnips. Dry them and then fry slowly in 2-ozs.
of butter until brown. Add 2-qts. of clear vegetable
stock and simmer until tender. Season with salt and
a teaspoonful of castor sugar. Chop some chervil or
parsley finely, add and serve. The addition of some
green peas is an improvement&mdash;and also quenelles
(see <a href="#r4">4</a>).</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span></p>

<p class="center large"><b><a name="r10" id="r10">10</a>. Green Lentil Soup.</b></p>

<p><span class="dropcap">F</span>ry 5 onions in a large saucepan until brown. Add
¾-lb. of green lentils, 1-qt. water, and 2 sticks
of celery. Stew for 2 hours, and pass through a
strainer. Add ¼-lb. of cream and ½-pt. of milk,
bring to the boil, flavour with salt, and serve.</p>


<p class="center large"><b>11. White Soubise Soup.</b></p>

<p class="center">(A French Recipe).</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>ake 2-ozs. butter, 4 good-sized onions, about 1-pt.
cauliflower water, and 1-pt. of milk, sufficient
bread (no crust) to very nearly absorb the liquor.
Cut up the onions, put into the saucepan with the
butter, and cook slowly till tender&mdash;it must not be
brown. Now add the bread, the cauliflower water,
and half the milk, and boil slowly for an hour. Take
it off the fire, pass it through a sieve, add the rest
of the milk, and heat it again, taking care it does
not actually boil, as it may curdle. Serve.</p>


<p class="center large"><b>12. Green Pea Soup.</b></p>

<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>ne quart shelled peas; 3 pints water; 1 quart
milk; 1 onion; 2 tablespoonfuls butter; 1 tablespoonful
flour. Salt and pepper to taste.</p>

<p>Put the peas in a stewpan with the boiling water
and onion and cook until tender (about half an hour).
Pour off water, saving for use later. Mash peas fine,
add water in which they were boiled, and rub through
<i>purée</i> sieve. Return to saucepan, add flour and
butter, beaten together, and the salt and pepper.
Gradually add milk, which must be boiling hot.
Beat well and cook 10 minutes, stirring frequently.
This recipe is useful when green peas are getting old
and are not tender enough to be enjoyable if served
in the usual way.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span></p>

<p class="center large"><b><a name="r13" id="r13">13</a>. White Haricot Soup.</b></p>

<p><span class="dropcap">S</span>tew ½-lb. of beans in 2-qts. of water, adding 5
chopped onions, some chopped celery and a
carrot which have been fried in some butter until
well cooked; stew until the beans are tender, and
strain if clear soup is required, or pass through a
sieve for thick soup; add some cream and milk,
bring to the boil, flavour with salt, and serve.</p>


<p class="center large"><b>14. Marmite Vegetarian Soup.</b></p>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>ake a dessertspoonful of Marmite, 1-pt. of water
or vegetable stock, a tablespoonful of fine sago
or tapioca, a slice or two of any vegetables, with
a sprig of parsley and a little salt. Boil the vegetables
for a few minutes in the water, skim well, add
the sago or tapioca, and boil for an hour or over,
then strain; stir the Marmite in and serve hot. A
delicious and cheap soup. A gill of milk or cream
boiled and added at the end&mdash;omit the same measure
of water&mdash;is an improvement in some cases.</p>


<p class="center large"><b>15. Almond Soup.</b></p>

<p class="center">(A nice Summer Soup).</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>ne pint of white stock, 1 pint milk, 1 small breakfastcup

<h2>GRAVIES AND SAUCES.</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">A</span> great variety of savoury and nutritious gravies
can be made from vegetable stock, with the
usual thickening, (arrowroot is best), a pinch of
salt and pepper, seasoning, and a lump of butter.
Brown haricot broth is the best stock (Recipe <a href="#r5">5</a>).
The addition of Nutril, Wintox, Mapleton's Gravy
Essence, or Marmite gives flavour and increases
the nourishing quality.</p>

<p>It is very desirable that the gravy or sauce served
with certain vegetarian dishes should be piquante in
taste and of a nice flavour. It is worth while to take
some trouble to achieve this result, because many
dishes that are plain and perhaps somewhat tasteless
in themselves are made quite savoury and enjoyable
by the addition of a piquante dressing. Brand's A1
sauce is a good example of such piquancy, and is also
useful in making sauces in the home, as a few
teaspoons of it will often give an unique flavour to
a simple gravy that is lacking in this respect.</p>


<p class="center large"><b><a name="r157" id="r157">157</a>. Walnut Gravy.</b></p>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>ake about 4-ozs. of shelled walnuts, put them
through the nut mill, and place in a small pan
in which you have previously made hot 1-oz. of
butter. Fry until the walnut is dark brown, <i>stirring
well</i> all the time to prevent burning. Pour on a pint
of stock, or water if no stock is at hand, and let it
simmer slowly until just before serving. Then add
1-oz. of flour to thicken, some seasoning, and a few
drops of onion or some tomato sauce. This makes a
most rich and savoury gravy&mdash;especially if a little nut
butter is added.</p>

<p class="center large"><b>158. Curry Gravy.</b></p>

<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>n the cold weather, dishes which contain curry are

minced in some butter until they are quite brown.
Then sift in some flour and let it brown also. Add

<h2>THE BREAD PROBLEM.</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">P</span>ure wholemeal bread, so made as to be light and well baked,
is a virtual necessity for every abstainer
from flesh-food. Food-Reform presents many difficulties,
and every dietetic reformer has to grapple with
them. Insufficient knowledge, defective sources of
provision, digestive troubles, inherited organic weakness,
and unfavourable environment, are only a few of
these. I want, therefore to emphasize the importance
of a perfect bread supply, which I am convinced is
the key to the problem so far as many are concerned.</p>

<p>It is not sufficient merely to pray for "our daily
bread," and then to leave its provision entirely to
Providence. We need also to <i>think</i> and to take some
personal trouble about it&mdash;remembering that Heaven
helps those who help themselves. Yet this is what
very few people do. One may safely affirm that four
persons out of every five are content to use defective
and innutritious bread every day of their lives. Yet
this should be made a real staff of life.</p>

<p>The whole grain of wheat, if of good quality,
contains nearly all that is needful for the perfect
nutrition of the body. With the addition of a small
amount of fat (easily found in nut or dairy butter,
cheese or oil), and of grape sugar and purifying acids
(obtainable in fruits), pure wheatmeal, if properly
ground in stone mills, and well made into delicious
home-baked bread, enables one to be almost
independent of other foods, and therefore almost
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
ensures one against a breakdown in health if there is
difficulty in obtaining a varied and well proportioned
dietary from other sources.</p>

<p>Instead of securing and using bread such as this,
the majority of the community complacently eat white
bread&mdash;emasculated, robbed of its gluten (which is
equivalent to albumen) and of the phosphates and
mineral salts that are stored in the inner part of the
husk of the grain. It is composed almost entirely of
starch, with the addition of such adulterants as the
baker or miller feels inclined to introduce for commercial
reasons, and is not conducive to the proper
operation of the digestive and eliminative organs.</p>

<p>It is difficult for bakers or the public to buy really
good wholemeal. The meal that is on the markets
often consists of cheap roller-milled flour with some
sweepings of bran or seconds thrown in. And even
if the entire grain is supplied, the outer cuticle of the
wheat, when <i>rolled</i> (in the modern steel-roller mills
that for reasons of economy have superseded the good
old-fashioned stone <i>grinding</i> mills), instead of being
so reduced as to be capable of complete digestion,
is left with rough edges called <i>spiculae</i>, which irritate
the digestive tract, cause relaxation, and arouse
prejudice against the 'brown' loaf. Such wholemeal
cannot be perfectly assimilated because the
bran is not properly broken up, and, in addition to
this fact, the cerealine, which acts like diastase in
the conversion of starch into sugar, is not liberated
and rendered available as an aid to digestion.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span></p>
<p>That the distasteful and often indigestible brown
or wholemeal bread (so-called) usually sold by bakers
is either defective or adulterated, can easily be proven
by anyone. Let any reader procure some stone-milled
entire wheatmeal that is guaranteed pure (I
use the 'Artox' and 'Ixion' brands myself, because
I believe them to be of genuine quality and properly
stone-ground); then make some thin loaves as
described in the following recipe. The result, if the
bread is skilfully made, will be a delicious and
nutritive loaf of the farmhouse type with a sweet
nutty flavour. Instead of quickly getting 'stale,'
such a loaf is enjoyable when four days old, and it
only needs to be compared with ordinary bakers'
bread to reveal the fact that it is an entirely different
article of food. Its sustaining power is wonderful,
and it proves an effectual preventive of starved
nerves as well as other ailments.</p>


<p class="center large"><b><a name="r225" id="r225">225</a>. How to make Wholemeal Bread.</b></p>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>he yeast must be quite fresh, and the bread should
be raised in separate tins <i>in a warm place or
cupboard</i>; the oven must be hot at first, but the
heat should be much reduced after 10 minutes.
Mix 6-lbs. of wholemeal with 1-lb. of household
flour. Then mix 3-ozs. of <i>fresh</i> yeast with a tablespoon
of treacle, adding 2 tablespoons of olive oil
when it is quite dissolved. Put this into the flour
with about 2-pts. of lukewarm water. Mix it with
a wooden spoon till it does not stick. Knead for
10 minutes, adding more water if necessary but
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
keeping the dough firm and spongy. Put it into
flat baking tins (well greased) about 2½ inches deep,
covering the tins to the depth of about 1 inch only.
Let it rise for 1 hour, or till it reaches the tops of
the tins. Then bake first in a quick oven, and
afterwards in a slower. A gas oven is most reliable
for baking bread, as the heat is more easily regulated.
The bread should be a rich dark golden brown when
well baked.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">M</span>ake as Recipe 225, but substitute household flour

<h2>SUMMER AND WINTER DRINKS.</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>he following recipes and suggestions concerning
a few beverages which can be used as substitutes
for more stimulating drinks may prove useful to many
readers:&mdash;</p>


<p class="center large"><b><a name="r233" id="r233">233</a>. Barley Water.</b></p>

<p><span class="dropcap">M</span>ix a tablespoonful of Pearl Barley with a pint of
water and boil for half-an-hour. Flavour with
lemon, cinnamon or sugar, according to taste, and
allow the mixture to cool. For invalids requiring
nutriment a larger quantity of barley should be
used.</p>

<p>Barley Water is equally suitable for winter use and
can be taken hot.</p>


<p class="center large"><b>234. Wheatenade.</b></p>

<p><span class="dropcap">S</span>immer 1-lb. of crushed wheat in 1-qt. of water for
about an hour, stirring it occasionally. Strain,
add lemon juice and sugar to taste, for use in
summer, or milk and sugar if the drink is taken hot
in winter. Good and clean bran can be substituted
for crushed wheat. This is a capital drink for
children with a tendency to rickets, or for persons
suffering from nervous prostration caused by malnutrition.</p>


<p class="center large"><b>235. Oatenade.</b></p>

<p><span class="dropcap">S</span>immer ¼-lb. of coarse oatmeal in the same manner
as described in the previous recipe, then flavour
to taste. This drink will be slightly richer in fat
than the previous one, and it makes a good winter
drink.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span></p>

<p class="center large"><b>236. Gingerade.</b></p>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>ake 1-dr. essence cayenne, 4-drs. essence of
ginger, 2-drs. essence of lemon, 1-dr. burnt
sugar, ¾-oz. of tartaric acid. Add 3-lbs. lump sugar
and 5-qts. boiling water. Bottle ready for use.
Dilute to taste.</p>


<p class="center large"><b>237. Fruit Drink.</b></p>

<p><span class="dropcap">L</span>ime juice, if pure, makes a cooling and wholesome
drink. The "Montserrat" is one of the purest
brands upon the market; some of the liquid sold
as lime juice is only a chemical concoction. The
weaker the solution the better it tastes. A dessertspoonful
to the tumbler is generally enough. Dole's
Pineapple juice is also an excellent fruit drink.</p>


<p class="center large"><b><a name="r238" id="r238">238</a>. Rice Water.</b></p>

<p><span class="dropcap">B</span>oil some once-milled rice in water, and add lemon
juice and sugar to taste. The beverage should
not be made too thick. As rice is often used in
most households a supply of this nutritious drink is
easily provided. It is very good for children.</p>


<p class="center large"><b>Tea and Coffee Substitutes.</b></p>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>hose who find tea and coffee undesirable should try
"Wallace P. R. Coffee," "Lifebelt Coffee,"
"Salfon," or "Horlick's Malted Milk." Another
good substitute is "Hygiama," which, unlike tea
and coffee, is not a stimulant, but a nutrient. On
the other hand its effect on the system is distinctly
stimulating in a right and healthy sense. That is
to say, the valuable nourishment which it contains
is very easily and quickly digested and an immediate
sense of invigoration is the result. Unlike cocoa,

<h2>HOW TO FEED INVALIDS.</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>n all cases of sickness the patient will have a better
chance of recovery if the diet is light and wisely
selected.</p>

<p>When inflammation and fever exist, fruit
<span class="figleft" style="width: 117px;">
<img src="images/illus_119.png" width="117" height="200" alt="" />
</span>and cooling drinks should be given,
and but little nitrogenous food.</p>

<p>An eminent physician writes thus:
"The fever patient, like the over worked
man, digests badly. He has
no appetite; his salivary glands do
not secrete, or secrete very imperfectly.
The gastric juice formed under bad
conditions is almost inert, poor in
pepsine and hydrocloric acid. The
liver no longer acts if the fever is high and serious;
the intestinal secretions are partially exhausted....
The fever patient must then be fed very little."</p>

<p>When the hydrocloric acid is deficient, proteid
food should be given very sparingly&mdash;one of the
best forms being Casumen in solution (see <a href="#r224">224</a>) or
white of egg. Milk is not advisable in such a condition,
unless malted, or in the dried form. Fats are
objectionable, and if the salivary secretions are
defective, starches should be given in dextrinized
(super-cooked) form, or well toasted. Fruit sugars,
which are Carbohydrates in a digested form, are better
still, and may be given freely to patients of nearly
all kinds. They are abundantly provided in figs,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
dates, stoneless raisins and sultanas, and in other
sweet fruits, such as bananas, strawberries and
apples.</p>

<p>Ample nourishment can be provided by these,
supplemented by egg dishes (chiefly white); flaked
and super-cooked cereals, such as Granose Biscuits,
Kellogg Wheat Flakes, Wallace P. R. and Flakit
Biscuits, Archeva Rusks, Melarvi Crisps, and
toasted or wholemeal bread; flaked or malted nuts;
legumes soufflé; well-cooked farinaceous puddings;
Horlick's Malted Milk and many other proprietary
health-foods; and vegetable broths&mdash;for which see
Recipes 1-23, as well as those which conclude this
section on pages 123 and 124.</p>

<p>One of the most important of these latter is
'Haricot Broth,' which is a perfect substitute for
"beef tea," being far more nutritious and also free
from the toxic elements which are contained in that
dangerous and superstitiously venerated compound.</p>


<p><span class="sidenote"><b>The Beef Tea Delusion.</b></span>
Dr. Milner Fothergill stated that probably
more invalids have sunk into their graves
through a misplaced confidence in the
value of beef tea than Napoleon killed
in all his wars. It is, in reality, a strong solution
of waste products and of uric acid, consisting largely
of excrementitious matter which was in process of
elimination from the system of some animal, through
the minute drain pipes which form an important
cleansing medium or "sewage system" in all animal
flesh. To make "beef tea," these poisonous
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
substances are stewed out to form the decoction,
while the animal fibrin, the portion of the meat that
has some nutritive value, is thrown away.</p>

<p>Beef tea consequently acts as a strong stimulant,
tends to increase inflammation and fever, and in all
such cases lessens the chance of the patient's recovery,
as the system is already battling against toxic elements
in the blood. To add to the amount of the latter
is obviously unwise and dangerous. These remarks
apply also to 'meat essences' and to 'beef extracts,'
which are frequently made from diseased flesh which
has been condemned in the slaughterhouses.</p>

<p>Meals provided for invalids should be very simple,
but served in a very dainty manner. A spotless
serviette and tray cloth, bright silver, a bunch of
flowers and a ribbon to match them in colour for
tying the serviette (the colour of which can be
changed from day to day) should not be forgotten.
The food should be supplied in small quantities; half
a cupful of broth will often be taken when a cupful
would be sent away untouched, and the wishes of
the patient should be respected so far as it is safe and
wise to do so. It is also a good plan to serve two
or three small separate courses, rather than to put
everything that is provided on a tray together.</p>

<p>Stewed French plums and figs are valuable in
the sickroom because of their laxative effects, and
dainty sandwiches will be found acceptable by most
invalids&mdash;made with flaked nuts and honey, dried
milk (Lacvitum), potted meat, etc.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span></p>


<p><span class="sidenote"><b>Don't Overfeed Invalids.</b></span>One of the greatest evils to be avoided
by those who are nursing the sick is
that of over-feeding. When nature is
doing her best to meet a crisis, or to
rid the body of microbes or impurities, it is a mistake
to cause waste of vital energy by necessitating the
expulsion of superfluous alimentary matter. Invalids
should not be unduly persuaded to take food. The
stomach generally requires <i>rest</i>, and is often in such
a condition that digestion is impossible.</p>

<p>Much of the suffering and inconvenience endured
by sick persons is simply the result of erroneous
diet. Judicious feeding will do far more than
drugs to alleviate and cure most maladies, in fact
drugs and stimulants are seldom required. The
great healing agent is the Life-force within&mdash;the
"<i>Vis medicatrix Naturæ</i>"&mdash;and the wise physician
will see that this power has a fair chance. He will
encourage hopeful mental influence, and advocate
pure air, pure food, and pure water, combined with
a cessation of any physical transgression which has
been the <i>cause</i> of the malady in question.</p>

<p>Care should be exercised lest invalids partake
too freely of starch foods, especially if such are
insufficiently cooked. Wholemeal bread should be
<i>light</i> and <i>well baked</i>, and in most cases it will be
more easily assimilated if toasted. Granose and
other similar biscuits (which consist of entire
wheatmeal in a super-cooked form, so that the
starch is already transformed into 'dextrin') will
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
be easily digestible and are slightly laxative in
their effect. They are just the right thing to
be taken with broth or soup or porridge. The
following recipes will be found helpful.</p>


<p class="center large"><b><a name="r239" id="r239">239</a>. Brown Haricot Broth.</b></p>

<p class="center">(A perfect substitute for 'Beef Tea.')</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>ake ½-lb. of brown haricot beans. Wash and
stew them with 1-qt. of hot water and some
small onions for 3 hours, stewing down to 1-pt.
Strain, and add pepper, celery-salt and butter when
serving. This bean tea or broth, so prepared, will
be found to be very savoury and of the same taste
and appearance as beef tea, while being much richer
in nutriment.</p>


<p class="center large"><b>240. Mock Chicken Broth.</b></p>

<p><span class="dropcap">A</span> valuable substitute for chicken broth, which is in
every way superior to the decoction obtained by
stewing the flesh and bones of the bird, can be made
by stewing and serving white haricots in the same
manner as in the previous recipe.</p>


<p class="center large"><b>241. Hygiama Apple Purée.</b></p>

<p><span class="dropcap">S</span>elect two or three sound ripe apples, wash and rub
in hot water, remove core and all bruised or dark
parts, but not the peel, cut in small pieces, place in
a covered jar or casserole with a cupful of water, or
sufficient to prevent burning. Cook gently until
apples are soft; then rub all through a fine sieve.
Mix a tablespoonful or more of Hygiama with just
enough water to form a paste, mix this paste into
the apple, with just a touch of cinnamon or nutmeg
if liked, and serve with pieces of dry toast, twice-baked
bread or rusks.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span></p>

<p class="center large"><b>242. Oat Cream.</b></p>

<p><span class="dropcap">A</span> most excellent recipe for invalids and anæmic
patients is prescribed by Dr. Oldfield, as follows:
Boil 1 pint milk, sift into it a large handful of crushed
oats. Simmer until it is thick as raw cream.
Strain and serve; the patient to take ½-pint, sucking
it through a straw slowly.</p>


<p class="center large"><b>243. Linseed Tea.</b></p>

<p><span class="dropcap">F</span>ew persons realize the good qualities of linseed tea.
It is useful for weak, anæmic and delicate persons;
it produces flesh, is soothing in bronchial cases, and
laxative. If made thin, and flavoured with lemon, it
is quite palatable, and many persons get fond of it.
The seed should be whole and of best quality, and it
only requires stewing until the liquor is of the
consistency of thin gruel.</p>


<p class="center large"><b>244. proteid Gruel.</b></p>

<p><span class="dropcap">A</span> good liquid food can be quickly made by warming
a dessertspoonful of "Emprote" or "Malted
Nuts" in a glass of milk, and flavouring to taste.
A large teaspoonful of "Casumen" (pure milk proteid)
dissolved in a breakfastcup of barley water,
coffee, or vegetable soup, also readily provides much
nutriment in a simple form.</p>


<p class="center large"><b>245. Lentil Gruel.</b></p>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>his is a useful and nutritious food for invalids.
To make the gruel, take a dessertspoonful of
lentil flour, mixed smooth in some cold milk, add
nearly 1-pt. of milk which has been brought to the
boil. Boil for 15 minutes and flavour with a little
cinnamon or vanilla. Serve with toast. This is the
same as the much prescribed "Revalenta Arabica"
food, but the lentil flour, without a long scientific
name, only costs 3d. a pound, instead of half-a-crown.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span></p>

<p class="center large"><b>246. Malted Milk Prune Whip.</b></p>

<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>ne cup of prunes, 2 tablespoonfuls Horlick's Malted
Milk, 1 tablespoonful sugar, lemon sufficient to
flavour, white of egg. Wash well, and soak the
prunes until tender. Boil with small piece of lemon
until soft. Add sugar, remove stones, rub through
colander; add the Horlick's Malted Milk, beat well;
add the white of egg, well beaten. Cool, and serve
with whipped cream. Flavour with vanilla if desired.</p>


<p class="center large"><b>247. Malted Milk Jelly.</b></p>

<p><span class="dropcap">P</span>hosphated gelatine 1 teaspoonful, Horlick's Malted
Milk 2 to 4 teaspoonfuls, sugar and flavouring
to suit. Soak the gelatine in cold water for 1 hour,
then dissolve in just sufficient hot water. Add the
Horlick's Malted Milk dissolved in 2 cups of hot
water, and sweeten and flavour to taste.</p>


<p class="center large"><b>248. Malted Milk with Iced Fruit.</b></p>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>ake of Horlick's Malted Milk 1 heaped teaspoonful,
crushed fruit 1 tablespoonful, crushed ice 1 tablespoonful,
1 egg, acid phosphate twenty drops, grated
nutmeg to flavour, water to make a cup. Mix the
Malted Milk, crushed fruit and egg, beating the
same for five minutes. Add the phosphate and
crushed ice, stirring all for several minutes. Strain,
and add ice-cold water or cold carbonated water,
and grated nutmeg to flavour.</p>


<p class="center large"><b><a name="r249" id="r249">249</a>. Effervescent Malted Milk.</b></p>

<p><span class="dropcap">P</span>ut some finely cracked ice into a glass. Fill it
half full of soda, Vichy or Syphon water, and
immediately add the desired amount of Horlick's
Malted Milk in solution. Drink while effervescing.
Brandy may be added if necessary.</p>

<h2>WHAT TO DO AT CHRISTMAS.</h2>



<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>he Christmas festival&mdash;which has degenerated into
such a deplorable orgy of massacre and over-feeding
<span class="figleft" style="width: 178px;">
<img src="images/illus_126.png" width="178" height="200" alt="" />
</span>in many countries
which are called 'Christian'&mdash;can
be observed and enjoyed without such barbarities
and butchery as
now take place.</p>

<p>How can we consistently
sing and talk of 'Peace
on Earth' when we are participating
in ruthless warfare against the animal
creation?</p>

<p>Is not this wholesale and cruel slaughter
altogether discordant with the spirit and doctrine
of the gentle and harmless Teacher of Nazareth,
whose terrestrial birth is thus celebrated by pagan
barbarity? Should not those of us who dare to
call ourselves His followers protest against a custom
which brings discredit upon His religion and causes
humanely disposed Oriental nations to regard it
almost with contempt?</p>

<p>The following suggestive Menu will at once
show my readers that Christmas can be celebrated
with a feast of good things without such butchery.
And many are they who have found that its joys
can even be enhanced by a sense of freedom from
blood-guiltiness and personal responsibility concerning
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
the deeds that are done in the shambles at this
time of 'Peace and Goodwill.'</p>

<p>The Menu can be varied as taste and circumstances
may dictate.</p>

<p>The cost of such a dinner as this will be much
less than that of a corresponding one which includes
poultry, game, and joints of flesh. The amount
saved could be appropriately expended in providing
a few comforts for the poor and needy&mdash;thus the

lessening the suffering in this world, and also for
increasing the sum of human happiness.</p>

<h2><b>Hints to Housekeepers.</b></h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">A</span> few simple hints to those who are trying the vegetarian
recipes in this book may be useful.</p>

<p>Cooking utensils should be kept quite separate
from those used for meat, fish or fowl.</p>

<p>Nut-oil or nut-butter should always be used for
frying, and the right heat is known when a slight
blue haze rises above the pan, or by dipping a finger
of bread in the oil, when if hot enough it will at
once fry brown and crisp. After frying it is always
best to place the articles fried on some folded tissue
paper to drain out the frying oil.</p>

<p>Marmite, Nutril and Carnos make good additions
to stock for flavouring soups and gravies.</p>

<p>In this kind of cookery there is no waste, all the
food is edible and anything that remains over from
dishes can be put together and made into curries,
stews, cottage pie, etc., etc.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span></p>
<p>Excellent Salads can be made by the addition of
uncooked scraped and sliced carrots and beetroot;
and also by chopping up very finely celery, Brussels
sprouts, French beans, green peas, cabbage, parsley,
onions, etc. The bright colours of these raw vegetables
are most useful in decorating galantines and
other cold dishes, and when arranged with regard to
colour, make a most artistic garnishing and are most
wholesome.</p>

<p>Pea nuts, pine kernels, and hazel nuts are much
improved in flavour by being put in a baking pan in
the oven until slightly browned.</p>

<p>Lemon juice is a good substitute for vinegar in
all sauces.</p>

<p>For making a smooth soup it is a good plan to
rub the vegetables after they are cooked through a
very fine hair sieve.</p>

<p>In making cutlets a stick of macaroni should be
inserted in the thin end of the cutlet to represent a
bone, it may be fried or not with the cutlet.</p>

<p>From several years' experience I have found the
non-flesh cookery is most economical, the expense
being less than half that of the corresponding meat
dishes.</p>

<h2>UNFIRED AND VITAL FOODS.</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>he following practical information and suggestions
will be found helpful by those who wish to test
the advantages of living solely upon uncooked foods&mdash;as
now recommended by so many progressive
physicians, dietetic specialists, and teachers of
hygiene. Although such a strictly simple and natural
dietary may at first involve some gustatory self-denial,
the benefits resulting from its use are declared
by many who speak from personal experience to be
well worthy of any inconvenience or sacrifice involved.</p>

<p class="center small"><b>List of Foods and Fruits. etc., that can be eaten uncooked.</b></p>

<p class="indent small">
<i>Cheeses</i>&mdash;Camembert, Cheddar, Cheshire, Cream, Dutch, Gorgonzola,

</p>

<p class="indent small">
<i>Fruits</i>&mdash;(Dried) Apples, apricots, currants, dates, figs, muscatels,
peaches, prunes or French plums, pears, raisins, sultanas, etc.
</p>

<p class="indent small">
(Fresh) Apples, bananas, blackberries, currants, cantaloupes,
cherries, damsons, gooseberries, greengages, green figs, lemons,
melons, mulberries, nectarines, orange, pineapple, pears, peaches,

etc.
</p>

<p class="indent small">
<i>Nuts</i>&mdash;(Fresh) Almonds, Barcelona, Brazil, cobs, coconuts, filberts,
Spanish, walnuts, etc.<br />
(Shelled) Almonds, Barcelona, cashew, hazel, pea-nut, pine
kernels, walnuts, etc.
</p>

<p class="indent small">
<i>Roots</i>&mdash;Artichokes, carrots, parsnips, turnips and potatoes (which
must be very finely grated).

</p>


<p class="center large"><b>RECIPES.</b></p>

<p class="indent small">
<i>Nut-meat</i>&mdash;2-ozs. shelled nuts, 1-oz. bread, 1 tablespoonful of milk.
Put nuts and bread through a nut-mill. Mix together with milk.
Roll out thin and cut into shapes with glass. This is sufficient
for two. Look well over nuts before using, do not blanch almonds
but rub them well with a cloth.
</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span></p>
<p class="indent small">
<i>Unfired Pudding or Cakes</i>&mdash;1-oz. each of dates, sultanas, currants,
candied peel and French plums, and 2-ozs. nuts. Put all through
a nut-mill and mix well together. Roll out and make into cakes.
For a pudding, put mixture in a well greased basin, press down,
leave for an hour or so and turn out. If too moist add breadcrumbs.
Serve with cream.
</p>

<p class="indent small">
<i>Unfired Dried Fruit Salad</i>&mdash;Ingredients as for pudding, but do not
put through a mill; chop all the fruit and nuts and serve dry
with cream.
</p>

<p class="indent small">
<i>Dried Fruits</i>, such as French plums, peaches or apricots should be
put in soak for 12 hours. Do not cook.
</p>


<p class="center large"><b>SALADS.</b></p>

<p class="indent small">
<i>Brussels Sprouts</i>&mdash;Use hearts only, which cut into small pieces.
</p>

<p class="indent small">
<i>Cabbage</i>&mdash;Use hearts only, which cut into small pieces.
</p>

<p class="indent small">
<i>Cauliflower</i>&mdash;Use flower part only, which cut into small pieces.
</p>

<p class="indent small">
<i>Chicory or Seakale</i>&mdash;Cut into small pieces.
</p>

<p class="indent small">
<i>Lettuce</i>&mdash;In the usual way.
</p>

<p class="indent small">
<i>Spinach and Mint</i>&mdash;Use leaves only, which cut up very small.
</p>

<p class="indent small">
<i>Root Salad</i>&mdash;Carrots or beetroot and turnips. Peel and put through
a nut-mill and mix well together.<br />

Most green salads are improved with the addition of radishes.<br />

Salads can be mixed ad lib., but a greater variety of food is secured
by using one or two vegetables only at a time.
</p>

<p class="indent small">
<i>Salad Dressing</i>&mdash;(1) Half a cup of oil, 1 tablespoonful of lemon juice
and the yolk of an egg. Mix egg with oil and add lemon afterwards.
(2) Half a cup of oil and one well mashed tomato mixed
well together.
</p>

<p class="indent small">
<i>Flavourings</i>&mdash;For Nut-meat&mdash;Use grated lemon peel, mint, thyme or
grated onion. For Dried Fruit Pudding or Cake&mdash;Use ground
cinnamon, grated lemon peel, nutmeg, ground or preserved
ginger.

<h2>USEFUL DOMESTIC INFORMATION.</h2>



<p><span class="dropcap">A</span> clove of garlic will give a very delicate and tasty
flavour to many soups and other dishes. For
<span class="figleft" style="width: 187px;">
<img src="images/illus_137.png" width="187" height="200" alt="" />
</span>
soups it is only necessary to rub
the tureen with the cut clove before
the soup is poured in. For
savoury dishes and stews one
small clove may be boiled (after
being peeled) in the stewpan for
five minutes.</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>o remove the skins from tomatoes place them in
boiling water for about two minutes.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>urnips taste much better if a little cream is added
to them after being mashed.</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>ny cold green vegetable can be used to make a
soufflé. It should be rubbed through a sieve,
and then 1 or 2 well-beaten eggs should be added.
A few drops of Tarragon vinegar may be used to
change the flavour. (See Recipe <a href="#r97">97</a>).</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">C</span>heese should be crumbly, as it is then more easily
digestible. It is a good plan to test it in the
following manner:&mdash;First buy a small piece and
melt a portion with milk in a double saucepan; if it
has a granulated appearance it is safe to buy some
more of the same cheese; if, on the contrary, it is
tough and stringy, it should be avoided, as it will be
found lacking in nutriment and will be very liable to
cause digestive troubles.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span></p>
<p><span class="dropcap">B</span>utter should be made to look dainty and appetising
by being prepared for the table with butter pats.
Small pieces can be twisted round to form the shape
of a hollow shell. It may also be rolled into marbles
and be garnished with parsley.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">P</span>arsley can be made a brilliant green by placing it
in a cloth (after chopping), dipping it in cold
water, and wringing it tightly in the hands, squeezing
it with the fingers. For garnishing savoury
puddings or fried potatoes, etc., this is worth
knowing.</p>

<p>Parsley which has been used for garnishing, or
which is in danger of going to seed, can be preserved
green for seasoning purposes by placing it in the
oven on a sheet of paper, and drying it slowly in
such a manner that it does not burn; it should then
be rubbed through a sieve and put into a bottle.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>ll boiled puddings should be allowed room to
swell, or they may prove heavy when served.</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>nstead of chopping onions, a coarse nutmeg grater
should be kept for the purpose, and the onion
should be grated like lemon rind. This saves much
time and labour and answers better for flavouring
soups, gravies, or savouries of any kind.</p>

<p>The addition of some bicarbonate of soda to the
water in which onions are boiled will neutralize the
strong flavour of the oil contained in them, and
prevent it from becoming troublesome to those with
whom it disagrees.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span></p>
<p><span class="dropcap">F</span>reshly cut vegetables are more digestible and
wholesome than those which have been lying
about in crates or shop windows. They also cook
more quickly. The water in which vegetables have
been boiled should be saved for stock for soups
and gravies (except in the case of potatoes).</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>o prevent hard-boiled eggs from becoming discoloured,
they should be plunged into cold water
as soon as they are removed from the saucepan.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>hose of my readers who wish to use unfermented
and saltless breads and cakes can obtain the same
from the Wallace P. R. Bakery. The purity of
goods supplied from this factory can be depended
upon.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>hen it is difficult to obtain pineapples for making
fruit salads, the same enhanced flavour can be
secured by adding some of Dole's Hawaiian Pineapple
Juice.</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>o prevent the odour of boiled cabbage pervading
the house, place a piece of bread in the saucepan.</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">F</span>laked nuts, if sprinkled over puddings, custards,
trifles or jellies, greatly improve the flavour and
appearance.</p>


<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>n the preparation of soups, stews, &amp;c., the preliminary
frying of the vegetables improves the
flavour and dispenses with any insipidity. The
oil should be fried until it is brown.</p>

<h2>HOW TO COOK VEGETABLES.</h2>


<p><b>Artichokes</b> should be boiled until tender only. If
over-boiled they become dark coloured and flavourless.</p>

<p><b>Asparagus</b> should be cut into equal lengths and
tied into bundles. These should be stood on end in
a deep stewpan, leaving the tops about an inch
above the water. When the stalks are tender the
tops will be cooked also. This plan prevents the
tops falling off through being over-cooked.</p>

<p><b>Cabbage</b> should only be boiled until tender; if
over-cooked it is pulpy and flavourless. Boiling too
fast causes the unpleasant odour to be given off
which is sometimes noticeable in a house when this
vegetable is being cooked. The lid of the saucepan
should not be used.</p>

<p><b>Cauliflower</b> must not be boiled until its crispness
is lost. It must be only just tender enough to eat. It
can be served 'au gratin' (<a href="#r120">120</a>), or as in recipe No. <a href="#r121">121</a>.</p>

<p><b>Carrots</b> should be steamed, not boiled. The
skins should then be wiped off and they should be
served with a white or brown gravy. They are also
nice if scraped, sliced and stewed in haricot broth
(recipe <a href="#r239">239</a>). The smaller the carrots the more
delicate will the flavour be.</p>

<p><b>Kidney or Haricot Beans</b> need to be carefully
trimmed so that all stringy parts are cut away.
They should be boiled until tender, and no longer,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
and served with thin white sauce. The smaller and
greener they are the better.</p>

<p>Old pods should remain unpicked until nearly
ripe, when the solid beans can be used for haricot
soup or entrées. The 'Czar' bean is the best to grow;
it is the giant white haricot, and the seeds are
delicious when picked fresh and cooked at once.
There is the same difference between fresh and dried
haricots, as between green and dried peas. Dried
Haricots must be soaked in cold water for twelve
hours before being cooked. They can then be stewed
until tender&mdash;the water being saved for soup or stock.</p>

<p><b>Vegetable Marrow</b> should be steamed or boiled
in its jacket. The flavour is lost if this is removed
before cooking.</p>

<p><b>Mushrooms</b> should be fried very slowly in a
small quantity of butter. They should be stirred
during the process, and the heat employed must be
very moderate indeed or they will be made tough.
They can also be stewed, and served in the gravy
when thickened with arrowroot.</p>

<p><b>Potatoes</b> should be cooked in their jackets. To
boil them in the best way, the water in the saucepan
should be thrown away when they have been boiled
for 5 minutes and cold water should be substituted.
This plan equalises the cooking of the interior and
exterior of the potatoes. When cooked they should
be drained, a clean cloth should be placed over
the pan and they should stand on the hot plate to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
dry. They should be lifted out separately, and
should be unbroken and floury. Sodden potatoes
ought to be regarded as evidence of incompetency
on the part of the cook.</p>

<p>Potatoes baked in their jackets are considered
by many to be preferable, and, as it is almost
impossible to spoil them if this plan is adopted,
it should be employed when the cook is inexperienced.</p>

<p>Fried potatoes, cooked in the Devonshire fashion,
are nice for breakfast. It is best to remove some
from the stewpan when half cooked on the previous
day. These should be cut up in a frying pan in which
a fair amount of butter has been melted, and the
knife should be used while they cook. In a few
minutes the potatoes should be well packed together,
so that the under-side will brown; an inverted plate
should then be pressed on them and the pan should
be turned upside down while the plate is held in
position with one hand. A neat and savoury-looking
dish will thus be made, but over-cooking must be
avoided previous to the browning process, or they
will look sloppy.</p>

<p>Potatoes can be mashed with a little milk and
butter. They should then be packed into a pretty
shape and garnished with chopped parsley (<a href="#r109">109</a>).</p>

<p>Another way of cooking them is to use the frying
basket and dip them in very hot Nutter. They
should either be cut into thin fingers previously,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
or else be half boiled and broken into pieces. This
latter plan is perhaps best of all, and they are then
termed "potatoes sauté," and are sprinkled with
chopped parsley before being served.</p>

<p>A very savoury dish can be made by boiling some
potatoes until nearly tender, and then putting them
in a pie dish with small pieces of butter sprinkled
over them; they should then be baked until nicely
browned.</p>

<p>To make potatoes <i>white</i> when cooked they
should be steeped in cold water for two hours
after peeling.</p>

<p><b>Peas</b> should be placed in a covered jar with a
little butter, and should be steamed until tender. No
water is required in the jar. The pods, if clean and
fresh, should be washed, slowly steamed, rubbed
through a colander, and added to any soup or other
suitable dish in preparation. Another method is to
boil the peas with mint, salt, sugar and a pinch of
bicarbonate of soda added to the water. Small
young peas should always be chosen in preference
to those which are old and large.</p>

<p><b>Spinach</b> should be cooked according to the
directions given in recipes <a href="#r90">90</a> to <a href="#r92">92</a>, or <a href="#r103">103</a>.</p>

<p><b>Beetroot</b> should be baked in the oven instead
of being boiled. By this method the flavour is
improved and the juices retained.</p>

<h2>LABOUR-SAVING APPLIANCES.</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">D</span>omestic work in the kitchen may be very much
simplified and lightened if proper utensils are
employed, and those who are able to do so should
obtain the following appliances, in addition to those
which are generally used:&mdash;</p>

<p><b>The 'Dana' Nut-Mill.</b> This is used for making
bread crumbs from crusts or stale bread; for flaking
nuts and almonds, etc., so as to make them more
easy of digestion, and nut-butter so as to make it
mix more conveniently with dough when employed
for making pastry and cheese&mdash;rendering it more
readily digestible. This nut-mill may be obtained
from G. Savage &amp; Sons, 33, Aldersgate Street,
London, E. C., and from Health Food Depôts
(price 7/6). It serves the same purpose as a sausage
machine as well.</p>

<p><b>A Frying-Basket</b> is necessary for letting down
rissoles, croquettes, cutlets, fritters, potato chips,
etc., into the stewpan which is kept for frying purposes.
The stewpan should be four or five inches
deep, so as to avoid the possibility of the Nutter or
vegetable fat bubbling over and catching fire upon
the stove. Aluminium or nickel are the best metals.</p>

<p><b>A Raisin Stoner.</b> It enables one to stone a large
quantity of fruit in a very short time. Most ironmongers
stock these machines.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span></p>
<p><b>A Potato Masher.</b> Necessary for flaking potatoes
and preparing haricot beans, peas, etc., for admixture
in rissoles or croquettes. By this means the skins
can be easily removed after they are cooked.</p>

<p><b>A Wire Sieve</b> (about 1/8th-inch mesh). Useful for
preparing spinach, and in many other ways which
will suggest themselves to every cook.</p>

<p><b>A Duplex Boiler.</b> For scalding milk by means
of a steam jacket. It prevents burning, and boiling
over. The <b>Gourmet Boiler</b> is a valuable cooking
appliance of the same sort. Failing these a double
saucepan is necessary.</p>

<p><b>A Chopping Basin</b>&mdash;a wooden bowl with a circular
chopper which fits it. This prevents the pieces
from jumping off and lessens the time occupied. It
is also less noisy and can be used while the operator
is seated.</p>

<p><b>A Vegetable Slicer.</b> The best appliance for this
purpose is a combination tool&mdash;made so that one can
slice carrots, etc., to any size and thickness, and also
core apples, peel potatoes and perform other functions
with it.</p>

<p><b>A Metal Frying Pan.</b> A nickel, aluminium,
or steel frying pan is almost a necessity. Enamel
chips off very soon and is dangerous, as it may
cause appendicitis.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span></p>



<h2>MEDICINAL AND DIETETIC
QUALITIES.</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>s it is important that those who adopt a reformed
diet should know something about the dietetic
and medicinal value of the articles
<span class="figleft" style="width: 136px;">
<img src="images/illus_146.png" width="136" height="200" alt="" />
</span>
they consume, the following information
may prove helpful:&mdash;</p>

<p><b>Apples</b> purify the blood, feed the
brain with phosphorus, and help to
eliminate urates and earthy salts from
the system. As they contain a small
amount of starch, and a good
proportion of grape
sugar combined with certain valuable acids, they
constitute a most desirable and hygienic food for all
seasons. They should be ripe and sweet when
eaten. People who cannot digest apples in the
ordinary way should scrape them, and thus eat
them in <i>pulp</i> rather than in <i>pieces</i>.</p>

<p><b>Bananas</b> also contain phosphorus, and are consequently
suitable for mental workers. They are
easily digestible, and nutritious, being almost a food
in themselves.</p>

<p><b>French Plums</b> are judicious food for persons of
nervous temperament and for those whose habits
are sedentary; they prevent constipation, and are
nutritious. They should be well stewed, and eaten
with cream, Plasmon snow-cream, or Coconut
cream (see recipe <a href="#r224">224</a>).</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span></p>
<p><b>Strawberries</b> contain phosphorus and iron, and
are therefore especially desirable for mental workers
and anæmic invalids.</p>

<p><b>Tomatoes</b> are good for those who suffer from
sluggish liver. The popular fallacy that they are
liable to cause cancer, which was circulated by
thoughtless persons some few years since, has been
pronounced, by the highest medical authorities, to
be unsupported by any evidence whatever, and to
be most improbable and absurd. In the Island of
Mauritius this fruit is eaten at almost every meal,
and Bishop Royston stated that during his episcopate
of eighteen years he only heard of one case
of the disease.</p>

<p><b>Lettuce</b> is soothing to the system and purifying
to the blood. It should be well dressed with pure
olive oil and wine vinegar (2 spoonfuls of oil to 1 of
vinegar, well mixed together, with a pinch of sugar).
A lettuce salad eaten with bread and cheese makes
a nutritious and ample meal. The thin and tender-leaved
variety (grown under glass if possible) should
always be chosen.</p>

<p><b>Figs</b> contain much fruit sugar which can be
rapidly assimilated, and are very nourishing and
easily digestible; when they can be obtained in their
green state they are specially desirable. They may
be considered one of the most valuable of all fruits,
and are most helpful in many cases of sickness on
account of their laxative medicinal properties.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span></p>
<p><b>Dates</b> are very similar to figs, and are both sustaining
and warming; they are easily digested if the
skins are thin.</p>

<p><b>Gooseberries</b>, <b>Raspberries</b>, <b>Currants</b> and <b>Grapes</b>
are cooling and purifying food for hot weather; but,
if unripe, they will often upset the liver. This type
of fruit should not be eaten unless <i>ripe</i> and <i>sweet</i>.</p>

<p><b>Walnuts, Hazel and Brazil Nuts</b> contain a considerable
amount of oil, and are consequently useful
for warming the body and feeding and strengthening
the nerves. Vegetable fat in this form is emulsified
and more easily assimilated than free animal fats, as
in butter, etc. Nuts are also rich in proteid matter.
Where people find that they cannot masticate nuts,
owing to impairment of teeth, the difficulty may be
removed by passing the nuts through a 'Dana' nut-mill.
When thus flaked and spread between thin
slices of bread and butter, with honey, they make
delicious sandwiches for lunch. A pinch of curry
powder (instead of the honey) makes them taste
savoury.</p>

<p><b>Chestnuts</b> contain a larger proportion of starch,
but are digested without difficulty when boiled in
their jackets until fairly soft. If eaten with a pinch
of salt they make a nice dish.</p>

<p><b>Pineapples</b> are valuable for cases of diphtheria and
sore-throat, as the juice makes an excellent gargle.
This fruit is considered to aid digestion in certain
cases.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span></p>
<p><b>Cheese</b> is very rich in protein&mdash;far more so than
lean beef. If well chosen, and new, it is a most
valuable article of diet, and feeds brain, nerves, and
muscles; but as it is a concentrated food it should
not be taken in excessive quantity. Half a pound
of cheese is almost equal to a pound of average flesh
meat. The best varieties are Wenslet, Gruyère
(very rich in phosphorus), Port Salut, Milk (<a href="#r155">155</a>),
Wensleydale, Cheshire and Cheddar.</p>

<p><b>Protose, Nuttose</b>, and similar malted nut-meats,
are more than equivalent to lean beef&mdash;minus
water, waste products, and disease germs. The
International Health Association first invented
these valuable substitutes for animal food, and has
an able advisory medical staff, therefore they may
be regarded as results of modern dietetic research.
Protose contains 25% protein and 14% fat.</p>

<p><b>White Haricots</b> are rich in protein (far more
so than lean meat), and should be eaten in
moderation. Brown haricots contain iron in addition
to their large percentage of protein.</p>

<p><b>Lentils</b> are almost identical in composition, but
are more suitable for those who do not have much
physical toil.</p>

<p><b>Peas</b> are slightly less nitrogenous than lentils and
haricots, but otherwise very similar; they are best
when eaten in a green form, and when young and
tender. When they are old the peas should always
be passed through a potato masher, as the skins
are very indigestible.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span></p>
<p><b>Macaroni</b> contains starch and a certain amount
of the gluten of wheat. Some of the best varieties
are made with eggs as well as flour. Tomato sauce
is the best accompaniment to it, with Parmesan or
grated and melted cheese (see recipes <a href="#r66">66</a> to <a href="#r71">71</a>).</p>

<p><b>Rice</b> as usually sold consists chiefly of starch,
but if unglazed and <i>once milled</i>, it is much more
nourishing, as the cuticle of the cereal (which is rich
in gluten and protein) is then left on it. The
addition of cheese or eggs, makes it a more complete
food (see recipes <a href="#r72">72</a> to <a href="#r80">80</a>).</p>

<p><b>Potatoes</b> consist principally of starch and water,
with a certain amount of potash. Their dietetic
value is not high.</p>

<p><b>Wholewheat Bread</b> contains, in addition to its
starch, much vegetable albumen, and a large supply
of mineral salts, such as phosphates, etc. It is,
therefore, when light and well cooked, of high
dietetic value both for flesh-forming and nerve
feeding. Physical workers should use it as a staple
article of food, and mental workers will also find it
most helpful. The coarser the brown flour, the
more laxative is the influence of the bread. This is
point worth noting.</p>

<p><b>Eggs</b> are nutritive chiefly on account of the
albumen which they contain in the white portion, but
they are liable to cause digestive trouble, and they
must not be taken too freely by those who are
subject to biliousness and constipation. Such
persons often find it advantageous to have them
boiled quite hard.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span></p>
<p><b>Emprote</b> (Eustace Miles proteid Food) contains
the proteids of wheat and milk (35%), with digestible
Carbohydrates (45.2%), fat (6.6%), and assimilable
salts (7.9%). It makes a good addition to soups,
beverages, and dishes lacking in protein.</p>

<p><b>Nuto-Cream Meat</b> is a modern substitute for
white meat and poultry, containing 19.7% protein,
48% fat, and 23% Carbohydrates. It is made from
nuts and corn, and is useful for invalids and young
children.</p>

<p><b>Milk</b> contains nearly all the elements necessary
for repairing bodily waste. It should be scalded for
half-an-hour in a double saucepan&mdash;to destroy
tubercular and other germs. If then allowed to
stand for 12 hours, clotted cream can be skimmed
off (as in Devonshire) and the milk can be used next
day. It keeps much longer after being thus scalded.
Dried milk is now procurable in such forms as
'Lacvitum' and 'Plasmon.'</p>

<p><b>Celery</b> is a useful blood purifier, and is valuable
in all cases of rheumatism, gout, &amp;c. Celery salt
is a valuable addition to soups and savoury dishes,
and is preferable to common salt.</p>

<p><b>Spinach</b> contains a considerable quantity of iron
in a readily assimilable form, and is, therefore, good
for anæmic persons.</p>

<p><b>Onions</b> have a wonderfully improving effect upon
the skin and complexion if eaten raw, and they act
powerfully as diuretics.</p>

<h2>HYGIENIC INFORMATION.</h2>




<p><span class="sidenote"><b>How to
Keep
Young.</b></span>Old age is accompanied by the accumulation
in the body of certain earthy
salts which tend to produce ossification.
The deposit of these in the walls of the
arteries impedes the circulation, and produces senility
and decrepitude. Flesh-food accelerates this process,
but the juices of fruits, and distilled or soft water, dissolve
out these deposits. The older one becomes the
more freely should one partake of fruit and soft water.</p>

<p>The more juicy fruit we consume, the less drink
of any kind we require, and the water contained
in fruit is of Nature's purest and best production.</p>

<p>Frequent bathing and the occasional use of the
vapour bath also help to eliminate these deposits,
and those whose skins are never made to perspire
by wholesome exercise in the open air must cause
this healthful operation to take place by other
means&mdash;or pay the penalty which Nature exacts.</p>



<p><span class="sidenote"><b>Food and
Climate.</b></span>Vegetable oils and fats produce heat
and build up the nerves. We require a
much larger amount of food containing
fat in cold weather and in cold climates than in warm
weather and in warm climates. By producing fruits
in profusion in the summer-time Nature provides for
the satisfaction of our instinctive desire for such
simple and cooling diet when the temperature is
high. But in winter-time more cheese, butter,
olive oil, or nuts, should be eaten every day.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span></p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><b>Cancer and
Flesh-eating.</b></span>
The latest declarations of some of the
principal British medical authorities on
'Cancer' are to the effect that people
become afflicted with this disease
through the excessive consumption of animal flesh.
The alimentary canal becomes obstructed with
decomposing matter, toxic elements are generated
and absorbed in the system, and cancerous cellular
proliferation ensues. It is noteworthy that fruitarians
are scarcely ever afflicted with this disease,
and that a strict fruitarian dietary (uncooked) has
often proved curative. See pages <a href="#Page_133">133</a> and <a href="#Page_166">166</a>.</p>



<p><span class="sidenote"><b>How to
avoid
Dyspepsia.</b></span>If the digestive process is unduly delayed
by overloading the stomach, or
by drinking much at meal-times so as
to dilute the gastric juice, fermentation,
flatulence and impaired health are likely to result.
Raw sugar if taken very freely with starch foods is
also apt to produce fermentation.</p>

<p>It is a mistake to mix acid fruits and vegetables
by eating them together at the same meal. Fermentation
is often thus caused, as vegetables take a long
time to digest. A very safe rule to observe, and
one which would save many from physical discomfort
and suffering, is this&mdash;only eat fruits which are
palatable in the natural uncooked state. Before Man
invented the art of cooking, he must have followed
this rule.</p>

<p>Those who suffer from dyspepsia will, in most
instances, derive benefit by taking two meals a day
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
instead of three&mdash;or at any rate by substituting a cup
of coffee or of hot skimmed milk and a few brown
biscuits for the third meal. Hard workers are the
only persons who can really get hungry three times
a day, and we ought not to take our meals without
"hunger sauce." Fruit alone, for the third meal is
better still.</p>

<p>The last meal of the day should not be taken after
seven o'clock at night. Disturbed rest and the
habit of dreaming are an almost certain indication of
errors in diet having been committed, or of this rule
having been infringed.</p>

<p>Probably the most valuable prescription ever given
to a patient was that given by Dr. Abernethy to a wealthy
dyspeptic, "Live on sixpence a day and earn it."</p>

<p>Constipation can nearly always be cured by adding
stewed figs, French plums, salads, etc., to one's
menu, by eating brown instead of white bread, and
by taking less proteid food.</p>

<p>Tea is detrimental to many persons. The tannin
contained in it toughens albuminous food, and is
liable to injure the sensitive lining of the stomach.
China tea is the least harmful.</p>



<p><span class="sidenote"><b>Rest
after
Meals.</b></span>Those who work their brains or bodies
actively, immediately after a solid meal,
simply invite dyspepsia. The vital
force required for digestion is diverted
and malnutrition follows. The deluded business-man
who "cannot spare the time" for a short rest
or stroll after lunch, often damages his constitution
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
and finds that he has been "penny wise and pound
foolish."</p>

<p>If the brain or body has been severely taxed, an
interval of rest should be secured before food is
taken. It is not <i>what we eat</i> that nourishes us, but
<i>what we are able to assimilate</i>. Recreation, occasional
amusement, and an interest in life are necessary.
Thousands of women die from monotony and
continuous domestic care; multitudes of men
succumb to mental strain and incessant business
anxiety. Chronic dyspeptics should reflect on these
facts.</p>

<p>Abstainers from animal-food who get into any
difficulty about their diet should seek advice from
those who have experience, or should consult a
fruitarian physician. The local names and addresses
of doctors who both practice and advise this simple
and natural system of living, will be supplied upon
application to the Hon. Secretary of The Order of
the Golden Age. Such are increasing in number
every month.</p>


<p><span class="sidenote"><b>Physical
Vitality.</b></span>
The human body is a storage battery
consisting of millions of cells in which
the vital electricity that produces
health, and makes life enjoyable, is accumulated.</p>

<p>Every manifestation of physical and mental power
depends upon the force stored up in this battery. The
more fully charged the cells the higher the voltage,
and, consequently, the greater the physical vitality
and power. This voltage is always fluctuating.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
Expenditure of force lessens it; recuperation, through
rest, sleep, the in-breathing of oxygen, and the
assimilation of vital uncooked food increases it.</p>

<p>Fruits, nuts, and root vegetables contain electrical
potency&mdash;they will deflect the needle of a highly
sensitive Kelvin galvanometer. But when cooked,
their vital electricity is destroyed&mdash;they become
<i>lifeless</i>, like flesh-food.</p>

<p>The accumulation of vital force is a possibility if
natural and vital food is selected.</p>


<p><span class="sidenote"><b>The Great
Healer.</b></span>
All the medicines in the world are as
the small dust of the balance, potentially,
when weighed against this
Life-force&mdash;which "healeth all our diseases and
redeemeth our life from destruction." Its therapeutic
phenomena are truly wonderful.</p>

<p>When our bodies are invaded by malevolent
microbes, the defensive corpuscles within us, if in fit
condition, destroy them. But if not fed with those
elements which are needful for their sustenance, they
soon "run down"&mdash;just as we ourselves get "below
par." We are then liable to become the prey of
those ceaseless microscopic enemies that are ever
ready to pounce upon the unfit.</p>

<p>If our corpuscles are weaker than the invading
foes, no drugs can save us&mdash;we are doomed.
Hence the importance of keeping ourselves and
our nerve centres well charged and in vigorous
condition.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span></p>


<p><span class="sidenote"><b>How to
Accumulate
Vitality.</b></span>To accumulate vitality our food must
contain all the chemical elements which
we need. None must be permanently
omitted. If, for instance, we entirely
exclude organic phosphorus from the food of a man
of great intellect, he will, in due time, be reduced to
imbecility. This is obtained in such foods as cheese,
milk, wholemeal bread, peas, apples, strawberries,
and bananas.</p>

<p>We must live by <i>method</i>, and take some trouble.
Nature's greatest gift is not to be obtained without
thought or effort. We must eat, breathe, and
live wisely; and the closer to Nature we get, the
better it will be for us.</p>

<p>The habit of deep breathing, like that of living
much in the open air, yields important results.
The atmosphere consists of oxygen and nitrogen&mdash;the
very elements of which our bodies are chiefly
constructed. Life and vigour <i>can be inhaled</i>, but
few persons have learnt the art.</p>

<p>Cheerfulness tends to promote the assimilation
of food. Exercise&mdash;of an intelligent and healthful
sort&mdash;is needful to make the life-current pulsate
through our tissues. Without it our organs do
not get properly nourished and rebuilt: stiffness
and atrophy set in. Worry and care must be
banished, and unwise or excessive expenditure of
nerve force avoided; for these things deplete the
human storage battery of its vitality.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span></p>
<p>Mankind is slowly gaining greater knowledge
of vital, mental, and spiritual truth. Ultimately,
"Life more abundant" will become the heritage
of the many instead of the few.</p>

<p>Self-emancipation from weakness and disability
is an achievement that will repay much effort on
the part of each one of us; and we can all render
beneficent social service by exemplifying the art of
living wisely.</p>

<p>By promoting hygienic and humane education,
we can prevent much suffering, and greatly
increase the sum of happiness in this world!</p>

<p class="center medium"><b>and How to Destroy it.</b></p>
<p class="center medium">By ROBERT BELL, M.D., F.R.F.P.S.</p>
<p class="center small"><i>Price</i> ONE SHILLING <i>Net (post free ½).</i></p>

<p class="center small">The latest pronouncement by this eminent Cancer Specialist on the
most terrible disease of our times.</p>

<hr />

<p class="small">This book is written by a Physician who has witnessed many cures
of advanced cases of Cancer, and who speaks from the standpoint
of forty years' experience.</p>

<p class="small">It contains 20 Art Plates, illustrating diagnoses from the Blood
when highly magnified, and proves by these object lessons the curability
of Cancer and the efficacy of treatment by Fruitarian Diet and Radium.</p>

<hr />

<p class="center">A FEW PRESS OPINIONS.</p>

<p class="small">"It is ... interesting and suggestive ... and it deserves a wide
circulation."&mdash;<i>Manchester Courier.</i><br />
<br />
"Every year, in England and Wales, 30,000 people die of Cancer&mdash;all of
which deaths are preventible. Dr. Bell's methods of preventing them are clearly
and forcibly given, once again, in this little book."&mdash;<i>Daily Mirror.</i><br />
<br />
"The wide prevalence of this terrible disease demands that attention should
be given to all endeavours to destroy it, and Dr. Bell is an authority whose
words should be carefully studied and acted upon."&mdash;<i>Northern Whig.</i><br />
<br />
"This interesting little treatise is an able presentation of the natural method
of dealing with Cancer."&mdash;<i>Two Worlds.</i><br />
<br />
"Dr. Bell is strongly of opinion that the Scourge is amenable to cure, and
his remedy is the use of Radium in conjunction with a special kind of Fruitarian
Diet. When one considers that every known remedy of the past has failed and
that this suggested cure has no revolting methods, such as the knife of the
surgeon, it should certainly receive the attention it merits."&mdash;<i>American Register.</i><br />
<br />
"The book should be worth reading to those interested in the subject."&mdash;<i>Irish
News.</i><br />
<br />
"He (Dr. Bell) deems 'dietetic purification essential,' and explains his
system, and it must be acknowledged that he is backed by very strong evidence,
which he gives. His little volume is worthy of the closest consideration by all
concerned."&mdash;<i>Letchworth Citizen.</i>
